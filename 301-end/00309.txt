Chapter 309 Final Battle (21)

"The insistence of a worm…"

The monster suddenly swung down five tentacles at the same time and hit Ethan from several directions. While he blocked the attack with his sword, he still began to be pushed back…

Ethan touched the tentacles, trying to drain the energy, but nothing happened. Just like Luneria said…. When the difference in power is too big, his power doesn't work.

"I have to find another way to make myself stronger," Ethan thought.

The enemy was using two tentacles to attack Ethan's friends, and they could fend for themselves, but only because they had the equipment that he gave them… each tentacle of the monster was as strong as an S-rank summoned hero.

Ethan clicked his tongue in exasperation and then enhanced his Sword with a shit ton of mana. When the enemy attacked, he unleashed all that energy against the five tentacles… the explosion made the Island vibrate and even made some chunks of the tentacles fall… However, soon they repaired themselves instantly…

"He is using chaos energy to regenerate that fast…" Ethan bit his lips.

Ethan faced some enemies that could do something similar, but not that insanely fast… still, the trick to deal with it was basically the same… cause more damage faster than the enemy could regenerate.

In a moment of inspiration, Ethan's instincts kicked into overdrive. With a sudden surge of energy, he charged headlong toward the onslaught of tentacles, his body spinning in a rapid whirlwind of motion. As he spun, his piercing power intensified, unleashing a devastating force that surpassed anything he had previously demonstrated.

The tentacles, caught off guard by this unorthodox maneuver, could do little to defend against the onslaught. Ethan sliced through the air like a whirlwind of destruction, his blade cleaving through the mass of tentacles with unparalleled precision. Five of them were overcome by his onslaught, their severed forms tumbling helplessly into the void of the dimension.

The impact of his attack sent shockwaves through the surrounding space, momentarily halting the monstrous entity in its tracks. Ethan's display of power and skill had left an indelible mark on the battlefield, showcasing his relentless determination.

Everyone looked surprised and amazed for a moment. Still, soon they saw the tentacles regrowing… the tentacles were two hundred meters long, and the beast regenerated half of that in the blink of an eye.

"As expected, going for the eye is the best option… it has less resistance, so I will cause more damage," Ethan thought. "The beast should flinch in pain as well, so I will have the chance to keep going."

As Ethan's gaze fixed upon the monstrous entity's eye, a realization struck him with clarity. The beast, with its cunning and awareness, had discerned his intentions. It was no longer oblivious to his strategy of targeting its vulnerable eye. A sinister smile crept across the creature's face, revealing its malevolent understanding.

The monster's heightened awareness presented a formidable challenge for Ethan. It was now fully aware of his plan to strike at its eye, and it would not allow him an easy opportunity. The beast's gaze bore into Ethan. Its malicious intent was evident. It would do everything in its power to thwart his advances, to protect its vulnerable point.

Ethan's mind raced, contemplating alternative approaches. He knew that going straight for the eye would be a perilous task, as the monster was now primed to counter his every move. He would need to devise a new strategy, one that would catch the beast off guard and exploit its weaknesses from unexpected angles.

The monster suddenly joined ten tentacles, one behind the other, and then swung it at Ethan while he was thinking. Somehow, he raised his sword and blocked the attack, but the impact sent him flying downward where his friends were.

Ethan ended up destroying the Island and forced his friends to move to another. He somehow recovered before he could fall into the void below and began to fly toward the others while hir body was aching all over. Still, he had an idea thanks to that…

The monster thought that Ethan would attack him again like the mad dog that he was. Still, instead of that, he approached his friends and touched them on the shoulder one after the other before the tentacles could reach them again. The monster had no idea what Ethan was planning. Still, it seemed suspicious… the creature only saw that it looked like Ethan had passed to them some kind of knowledge since they stopped moving for a short while to absorb the information.

Ethan approached the beast again and glared at it for a moment. Chaos looked at Ethan, trying to understand his actions, but it seemed that nothing had changed since Ethan charged blindly yet again.

The monster used its ten tentacles to attack Ethan again since it knew that it was enough. Still, then all of a sudden, its tentacles were split in half… the creature looked to the side and then saw Dante using Omni Armor and with his sword pointing toward the beast.

Ethan, realizing the immense power and potential of the Omni Armor, saw an opportunity to empower his comrades in their struggle against the monstrous entity. With a resolute determination, he began to share his knowledge of the usage of the formidable armor.

The beast was caught by surprise since it didn't imagine that Dante would be able to cause that much damage, but soon used twenty tentacles to attack Ethan… this time, Emily was the one who suddenly froze over the tentacles in mid-air before they could hit Ethan… once again, the beast saw someone else using the Omni Armor.

Before the monster had the chance to use it's tentacles again, Ethan reached its eye, but before he could pierce it, he stopped midair while he was only five centimeters away from it. In the next moment, Ethan began to fall insanely fast… the group realized when he disappeared in the distance that the enemy altered the gravity to stop him instantly and make his body thousands of times heavier.
