Chapter 301 Final Battle (13)

Even though Ethan had faced countless enemies, he had never faced one that ignored his defenses like that… his armor wasn't even being affected.

The enemies' ability to unleash such devastating attacks and display intricate knowledge was rooted in their access to the essence and knowledge of countless individuals who had perished with unresolved regrets. As agents of chaos, they possessed a unique connection to the collective consciousness of those lost souls, tapping into their combined experiences and wisdom.

Through this connection, the enemies gained insight into the battle's intricacies and their adversaries' vulnerabilities. They drew upon the departed's knowledge and regrets to enhance their power, leveraging the collective essence to develop formidable techniques and tactics.

Ethan felt like his body was melting from the inside out, but soon, the attacks stopped when Dante swung his sword, and then suddenly, a chunk of flesh fell from the faces of the monsters.

"That is right… he can do something like that," Ethan thought.

"Defensive spells won't work against that!" Dante said. "You either dodge it or block the enemies field of vision! Emily, Aline!"

As Emily and Aline struggled against the oppressive gravitational field, their movements slowed to a crawl. The intense force exerted upon them threatened to render their actions futile. However, this unintended consequence provided a valuable opening for Ethan to assess the situation and strategize his next move.

The slowed movements of Emily and Aline allowed Ethan to carefully observe their predicament and identify the most vulnerable point among their adversaries. With a calculating gaze, he honed in on the creature responsible for the gravitational manipulation, recognizing its significance as a linchpin in the enemy's strategy. This newfound clarity amid the chaotic battlefield allowed Ethan to make a decisive choice.

Ethan jumped toward the giant bird, and the creature flew away while looking at him. When Ethan disappeared, the beast suddenly turned and saw him behind. It actually could follow Ethan…

Ethan looked at his friends and saw that they were still under the effects of the gravity spell. Still, Emily and Aline combined their powers to fire a massive blast of ice that blocked the lasers of the four-legged silver monster.

At the same time, Dante was trying to attack the reptile-looking monster. Still, every time he took a chunk of the monster's body, it would quickly regenerate.

"These are only the minions, and we are having such a hard time already…" Ethan muttered.

All of a sudden, the giant bird suddenly screamed, and then a dark purple sphere formed in front of it.

The giant bird, fueled by its chaotic nature, unleashed a powerful beam of purple energy aimed directly at Ethan. The sheer force and malevolence behind the attack sent chills down his spine, causing a cold sweat to break out across his brow. The beam carried an ominous energy that threatened to overwhelm him.

As Ethan attempted to evade the devastating attack, he found himself caught in a precarious situation. The pull of the beam's force exerted a gravitational influence, drawing him back toward its source. With each passing moment, the bird's relentless pursuit and the gravitational pull of the beam intensified, creating a formidable challenge for Ethan to overcome.

Fighting against the combined forces of the bird's assault and the gravitational pull, Ethan focused his energy on maneuvering and staying out of the beam's direct path. His instincts kicked into overdrive as he utilized his agility and flight to dodge and weave, desperately seeking a way to break free from the relentless pursuit.

"A gravity attack that has a homing effect as well?" Ethan wondered while he was flying away from the beast.

The monster was still feeding the attack with energy, so Ethan could tell that getting hit by it would be more than a bit painful. Trying to absorb the attack would also be madness since the gravitational pull would crush his body.

Like a bird of prey eluding its hunter, he weaved through the air, executing rapid and unpredictable zigzag patterns. His movements became a symphony of agility and speed as he darted in all directions, desperate to elude the relentless pursuit of the giant bird's attack.

With every twist and turn, Ethan sought to create distance between himself and the beam of purple energy. He utilized his aerial prowess to its fullest extent, changing directions swiftly and fluidly, leaving a trail of motion behind him.

"I can't make that thing waste energy, I guess…" Ethan said while looking at his friends.

They were still under the effects of the gravitational trap. Ian used his intangibility to attack the giant reptile monster. Still, the creature attacked him with the darkness Cannon… even while he was intangible and impossible to see, it could sense him.

In the end, Anna summoned a bunch of golems with her potions, and their weight made the floating island fall apart, freeing them from the gravity trap.

The group began to fall into the void, but Mary used her Frost Breath to freeze the air and create a path for them. However, the giant monsters had the chance to attack them again.

Dante stopped moving and concentrated all his power, and when the enemies fired their attacks, he swung his sword… even from so far away, he made the attacks explode on the monster's faces. Still, he fell on his knees while holding his right arm… he was exerting himself.

"... It can't be helped," Ethan said, and then he stopped moving.

Ethan's desperation reached its peak as he confronted the relentless assault of the giant bird's gravity cannon. With a resolve fueled by sheer determination, he brought his hands together, forming a barrier between himself and the overwhelming force of the attack. The collision of his palms against the powerful energy sent shockwaves through the air, a testament to his unwavering will.As Ethan attempted to absorb the tremendous energy, his body strained under the intense gravitational forces unleashed by the attack. The weight of the opposing forces threatened to crush him, exerting immense pressure that took a toll on his physical form.
