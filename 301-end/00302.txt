Chapter 302 Final Battle (14)

Each passing moment pushed his limits, causing him to endure increasing amounts of damage.

Fortunately, Ethan wasn't fighting alone. Using her magic, Emily threw one Elixir toward Ethan. The bottle broke on his back, and that gave him the relief that he needed… Ethan's mind cleared for a moment, and then he let the attack hit him while he opened his arms.

Emily thought that Ethan had lost his mind. Still, soon, she felt his body glowing, emitting that dark purple glow… he was absorbing even more of the chaotic energy in the environment.

"That is it. I am not helping him anymore," Emily said after she stomped on the ground. "How can someone be so stupid?"

Fortunately, it seemed that Ethan wasn't as stupid as Emily assumed. As the overwhelming energy from the gravity cannon surged toward Ethan, he focused his will. He channeled it through the conduit of his Pandemonium Sword. The sword, once dormant, now pulsed with an otherworldly glow, resonating with the chaotic energy coursing through it. The blade seemed to come alive, its power surging to match the magnitude of the attack.

With a newfound strength, Ethan maneuvered the Pandemonium Sword with unwavering determination, positioning it in the path of the incoming assault. The pulsating glow intensified as the sword absorbed the energy, transforming it into a formidable barrier of resistance. The clash of forces reverberated through the air, creating a momentary stalemate as Ethan's sword held firm against the overwhelming power of the gravity cannon.

When the enemy realized that it was useless to continue with the attack, the giant bird stopped and then studied Ethan only for a moment. In the end, Ethan swung his sword and fired a slash of energy toward the monster.

The beast did the same, and then both attacks hit each other. The fabric of the dimension itself quivered with an unsettling energy, trembling under the weight of a growing disturbance. A small black hole materialized, its presence ominous and all-consuming. Its intense gravitational pull exerted a relentless force, drawing everything in its vicinity toward its inescapable grasp.

Within this chaotic maelstrom, the very essence of the dimension was threatened. Objects, debris, and even the air itself were caught in the irresistible pull of the black hole. The surroundings were warped and distorted as the dimension itself seemed to strain under the immense gravitational forces at play. The once-stable environment now felt volatile and precarious, as though the very laws of reality were being warped and tested.

The giant enemies felt the strength even more since they weighed over dozens of tons, and Ethan smirked when he realized that.

"Ethan! Don't do anything stupid!" Emily shouted when he realized what he was thinking.

"The word stupid doesn't exist in my vocabulary," Ethan smiled and then charged his sword with even more mana and fired another slash of mana toward the black hole.

As the black hole threatened to consume the dimension, Ethan's attack, fueled by his indomitable determination, struck the heart of the chaotic vortex. Rather than neutralizing the threat, however, the force of his assault seemed to feed the black hole, empowering it with a surge of newfound strength. The black hole expanded exponentially, its gravitational pull intensifying and doubling in size.

The gravity trap ended so the Ethan's friends could move, but they were being pulled by the black hole as well. The giant bird began to flap its wings in the opposite direction while it used its magic to close the black hole, but it was a slow process.

Ethan used that chance to approach and attack the giant monster from behind. Like a lightning bolt, he slashed the back of the monster's head and beheaded the beast that began to be pulled by the pull of the black hole while it was being crushed by it.

Dante leaped forward with unwavering resolve as the other monsters desperately attempted to escape the engulfing pull of the black hole. His swift movement and masterful swordsmanship allowed him to close the distance with the giant reptile monster. With a precise strike, he cleaved into its back, disrupting its control over its own body.

The reptile monster, momentarily thrown off balance by Dante's attack, faltered in its attempts to escape the clutches of the black hole. Its movements became erratic and uncoordinated, leaving it vulnerable to the gravitational forces that threatened to consume it. Dante's intervention provided a critical opportunity for the group to regroup and strategize amidst the chaos.

While that monster was being sucked by the black hole, Emily, Aline, Anna, and Mary used all of their powers to freeze the four-legged monster. The creature quickly began to turn into a massive sphere of ice that also began to be pulled by the black hole.

The monster used its lasers to try to free itself, but the girls didn't stop their attacks, and eventually, the final beast was devoured by the black hole.

The once formidable creatures, with their chaotic energy and formidable strength, were no match for the all-consuming power of the black holes. Their bodies were torn apart, shredded into fragments, and swiftly devoured by the insatiable void. The destructive force of the black holes obliterated everything in their path, leaving nothing but remnants in their wake.

The group, witnessing the annihilation of their adversaries, stood in awe and horror at the relentless power unleashed by the black holes. The sheer scale of destruction was a chilling reminder of the immense forces they were up against. It was a somber realization of the cost of their battle, the sacrifices made, and the relentless pursuit of their goal.

"That wasn't a good thing to see…" Ethan said when he landed.

Ethan deactivated his Omni Armor, and he didn't look different than before. Even his presence was the same as always, so his friends sighed in relief.

"It seems that you are fine since you sent all the energy to the sword…" Emily said while hiding her surprise.
