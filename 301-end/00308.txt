Chapter 308 Final Battle (20)

As the colossal head loomed before them, the weight of its presence pressed upon their spirits. They could feel the malevolence emanating from its very core, a reminder of the formidable adversary they faced. The sheer size and grotesqueness of the entity instilled both dread and determination within the group.

"Now, this sure looks like something that deserves the name of chaos…" Ethan thought and gulped.

Taunting the monster was too dangerous since it was clearly much stronger than anything Ethan had faced until now. Everyone also felt overwhelmed, and they also found it hard to keep their legs steady.

"Ah, foolish mortals. Do you not comprehend the futility of your endeavors? Your arrogance in believing you could stand against me, the harbinger of chaos itself, is laughable."

In all its malevolence, Chaos reveled in the opportunity to taunt and provoke Ethan and his friends. It relished in the opportunity to shatter their spirits and fuel their despair. With every word, chaos sought to undermine their resolve, reminding them of their insignificance in the face of its power.

"Your futile attempts to halt the march towards balance between chaos and order only expose your ignorance. You dare to challenge the very essence of existence, to disrupt the delicate dance of chaos and order that governs the universe. But know this—your actions are but feeble gestures in the grand tapestry of existence."

A malevolent laughter echoed through the dimension, sending chills down the spines of Ethan and his friends. Chaos reveled in their vulnerability, delighting in their inner turmoil. It sought to crush their spirits, to make them question the very foundations of their purpose.

"Despair, for it is your arrogance that has brought you to this realm. You dare to defy the natural order, to challenge the very forces that govern existence. But in the end, you shall find no victory, no solace. Only the bitter taste of defeat and the annihilation of your hopes and dreams."

As the monstrous entity unleashed its tentacle with a vicious swing, Ethan swiftly reacted, raising his sword to intercept the attack. The impact reverberated through his body, sending a shockwave of pain surging through his muscles. It felt as if a tremendous force, like that of a speeding truck, had collided with him, threatening to knock him off his feet.

The sheer power behind the strike left Ethan momentarily staggered, his grip on his sword tightening as he fought to maintain his balance. The force of the blow resonated through his entire being, testing the limits of his endurance. It was a stark reminder of the overwhelming strength possessed by the monstrous foe they faced.

"Even if I didn't use Omni Armor… this much power is insane," Ethan thought once he confirmed that he lost half of his health.

The enemy had thousands of those tentacles, and Ethan knew that he couldn't block them all at once or even in a sequence… still, he quickly used Omni Armor and Berserker.

"Raise your weapons and fight. There is no point in letting the surprise get the better of all of you," Ethan declared.

Ethan soared through the air, determination etched on his face as he aimed to strike at the vulnerable eye of the monstrous entity. With all his might, he propelled himself forward, ready to deliver a decisive blow. However, his charge was abruptly halted as a flurry of tentacles lashed out with lightning speed, striking him with relentless force.

One after another, the tentacles collided with Ethan's body, their impact reverberating through his being like a series of thunderous blows. The sheer velocity and precision of the attacks left him reeling, his vision momentarily blurred. Each strike felt like a whip cracking against his flesh, testing the limits of his endurance.

The impact of each attack reverberated through the air like lightning bolts. Ethan was left shocked because the beast wasn't only strong, but it was faster, too…

The creature's eye, filled with an ancient darkness, held a profound sense of animosity towards Ethan. It recognized him as a threat, an obstacle in its path toward domination and chaos. The intensity of its gaze seemed to convey its utter contempt for his audacity in opposing its grand design.

As the eye bore into Ethan's, he felt a shiver crawl down his spine. It was as if the monster's gaze sought to strip away any semblance of hope or strength within him. But instead of succumbing to the weight of that stare, Ethan steeled himself. He met the creature's gaze head-on, defiance burning in his eyes, refusing to be consumed by the overwhelming darkness radiating from its single eye.

Instead of attacking Ethan, the monster used its tentacles to attack the others all at once in order not to give them a chance to help each other. Dante managed to block the attack with both his sword, and Aline pushed the tentacle away by using wind magic.

Emily also froze the tentacle over, but it only lasted for a short while. Ian dodged the attack, but that made the entire Island tremble.

As for Mary and Anna, they used numerous golems and ice magic to stop the attacks, but those were immediately destroyed, and they barely avoided the tentacles by jumping away.

"You can only do this much against fifteen of my arms? Do you understand the hubris that is your arrogance of thinking that you actually have a chance against me?"

Ethan's frustration boiled within him as he clicked his tongue in annoyance, refusing to be deterred by the relentless assault of the tentacles. With unwavering determination, he once again launched himself towards the monstrous entity, his resolve unyielding. However, the creature responded with a barrage of tentacle strikes, each blow aiming to halt his advance.

Yet, Ethan was not so easily dissuaded. He skillfully maneuvered through the onslaught with lightning-fast reflexes, his blade slashing with precision and ferocity. The tentacles that dared to impede his path were swiftly met with the keen edge of his sword, their strikes deflected or severed entirely. The wounds inflicted were minimal, though.
