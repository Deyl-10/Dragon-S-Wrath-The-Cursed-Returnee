Chapter 185 Contact

"I think it is like that. Now you just have to control it to become thicker while using less mana than you can recover using Meditation," Ethan declared. "After that, it comes the second step of absorbing the mana to expand the internal limits of your mana pool."

"Easier said than done," Emily said and then opened her eyes, looking exhausted. "I can't lose my focus for even a moment here."

"Well, get used to it. Let's do some tests, keep the layer active, and then I will attack you," Ethan said. "Before you complain, the mana probably will protect you. Mana is your spiritual energy, so it is only natural that it will do that when it is being emitted without a proper function."

Emily's brows furrowed with concern as she cast an uncertain glance toward Ethan. Her eyes betrayed a mix of worry and perplexity, reflecting the growing unease within her.

The more Ethan shared his ideas, the more they seemed to veer into realms of wild imagination and daring. While his unconventional thinking had led them on incredible adventures before, there was something different this time. It was as if his ideas were becoming progressively more audacious and unpredictable, bordering on the line of sheer madness.

As Emily considered the implications of Ethan's latest proposal, her mind raced with conflicting thoughts. On the one hand, she admired his boundless creativity and his ability to think outside the box. It was part of what made their journeys together so exhilarating and memorable.

However, a nagging doubt tugged at her, causing her to question the feasibility and practicality of Ethan's increasingly unconventional strategies. She worried that his willingness to take risks could lead them into dangerous territory, jeopardizing their safety and the success of their missions.

Still, Emily knew that Ethan wouldn't truly hurt her, so she began to meditate and activate the technique. However, when that started, she recalled what Ethan could do… absorb energy.

When he opened her eyes, she saw Ethan flicking her forehead. She felt her mana being absorbed, but only a bit. She also felt her mana being drained to block the attack and protect her completely, and that had been a lot more.

"... Although you never sound convincing, your guess was correct," Emily said. "What kind of forehead flick is this… it took ten percent of my mana!"

"That is just the level of my strength, but putting that aside, it seems that mastering this will take a while," Ethan said while looking at the exhausted Kei and Hana, who tried to follow in the same footsteps."

"It will be hard for you guys, but Kei will benefit a lot from this since you can use clones. Can you make them meditate as well?" Ethan asked. "I can, but I can't receive it back… they can use the extra mana themes, though."

Ethan wondered how he could learn that technique; he wanted to learn and improve it. Until he could get the experience of his clones and make them go to school for him. That would be da life.

The group gathered in their designated training area. Their determination was palpable in the air. Side by side, they practiced the technique Ethan had introduced, honing their skills and pushing their limits. With each passing day, their proficiency grew, and the once unfamiliar maneuver began to feel more natural.

I think you should take a look at

They dedicated hours to repetitive drills, focusing on the precise movements required to channel and manipulate mana effectively. Under Ethan's guidance, they refined their control and gradually improved, striving to reach the next stage of mastery.

As the week progressed, their efforts bore fruit. The translucent aura surrounding their bodies became more pronounced, shimmering with newfound strength. The technique had evolved, its potency growing with each passing day. They were on the cusp of a breakthrough, poised to further their abilities.

However, Emily's concern grew like a shadow in her mind amid their progress. Ian had been conspicuously absent. The lack of communication from him raised a sense of unease within her. She couldn't help but worry about his well-being and the reasons behind his sudden disappearance.

"He is probably scared shitless of me; I am still waiting for my golden chance," Ethan said. "I will have my revenge."

"I sent some messages to him as well, and he didn't answer either," Emily said while checking the internet for anything suspicious about the blue soldiers being sent back to their homeland after they were forced to abandon their weapons and armor. Ian's family act in the shadows, so I guess it will be hard to find if they are up to something."

"Knowing that won't change a thing," Ethan said. "If they don't want help, then you can't help it."

As the days stretched on without any word from Ian, Ethan couldn't help but wonder what he was up to. It was unlike Ian to miss a week of lessons, especially when it came to their charismatic instructor, Lyla. Ian was always simply for her, after all.

However, this time, the absence felt different. It wasn't just about Ian missing out on the chance to be near Lyla or to impress her with his dedication. Something deeper seemed to be at play, and Ethan's mind raced with possibilities.

He mulled over the idea that Ian's family might be involved in a secret experiment. Although it was pure speculation, Ethan couldn't shake the feeling that they were preparing for something significant. The thought of a revival, perhaps of Ian's late mother, lingered in his mind as if a puzzle piece waiting to be placed.

Ethan hadn't received any confirmation or evidence to support his suspicion. Still, his intuition, combined with the knowledge of Ian's family background, fueled his belief. The notion seemed intriguing as he pondered the potential consequences and the toll it might take on that moron.

"Don't you have Anna's contact?" Emily asked.

"Why would I have?" Ethan furrowed his eyebrows. "That brat is insupportable."
