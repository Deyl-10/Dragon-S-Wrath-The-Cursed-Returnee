Chapter 189 Piano Lessons

The following week seemed to pass by in a blur, with time slipping through their fingers like sand. The team remained on high alert, awaiting any updates or developments regarding Ian's family and the situation they had potentially triggered. Emily, however, surprised Ethan with her rapid progress in learning the technique to absorb mana.

Ethan had been under the impression that mastering the technique would take considerable time and effort. Yet, Emily's ability to grasp it swiftly astonished him. He observed her diligently practicing, honing her skills with determination and focus. It was evident that she possessed a natural affinity for mana manipulation, a talent that Ethan couldn't help but admire.

While Ethan felt a tinge of surprise, he also harbored a sense of pride for Emily's rapid growth. He recognized her dedication and commitment to becoming stronger, which only further solidified her value as a crucial member of their team. Her newfound proficiency in absorbing mana opened up new possibilities and strategic opportunities in their upcoming battles.

"Finally… I should brag to Kei and Hana," Emily said while shadowboxing. "This will be fun."

"And I thought I was the untactful one," Ethan furrowed his eyebrows. "Nothing better to lift the spirits of someone who couldn't leave their apartment for one week than brag about such a thing."

Despite Ethan's words, Emily still called them. Based on what Emily was saying throughout the call, Ethan assumed that they killed time by training with the technique. They were also almost there as well.

"Eh? Are you returning? Why?!" Emily raised her voice. "I see… I suppose it can't be helped. Well, we can keep in contact and meet now and then… until the next time."

Upon learning that her newfound friends were planning to return to Japan, a wave of melancholy washed over Emily. It was a bittersweet realization, for she had formed a deep bond with them during their shared adventures and trials. The thought of parting ways and bidding farewell left her feeling a profound sense of sadness and loss.

Emily had grown accustomed to their presence, cherishing the camaraderie and friendship they had developed over time. They had become a source of comfort, support, and understanding in the face of the unknown. The prospect of their departure meant that the dynamic of their group would forever change, and it weighed heavily on Emily's heart.

"You might develop some psychological problems with those mood swings," Ethan said.

"... I hate farewells," Emily said after the longest sigh that Ethan had ever seen. "My two friends will return to their homes, probably because of that moron, and two morons will return."

"I see… I guess they will send Dante to investigate what happened with Ian's family," Ethan said. "Still, it isn't fine; without Ian to bother us, we can use Mana Force as much as we want without interruption."

"Is that how you named the technique?" Emily asked.

"My system did that," Ethan replied. "By the way, I want to check the effects of the technique on you, so try to use it and stop when your mana Increases."

"Okay," Emily said.

In the end, that happened after just five minutes… Ethan had no idea why that was the case. He didn't like the idea that his technique was three times slower with him.

As Ethan observed Emily's remarkable progress with Mana Force, he couldn't help but ponder the reasons behind her exceptional aptitude. In his introspective moments, he mulled over the factors that made her proficiency with Mana Force surpass his own.

I think you should take a look at

One possibility that crossed his mind was Emily's innate connection to their world's magical energies. It seemed as though she had an inherent affinity for mana. This natural attunement allowed her to tap into its vast potential with ease. This connection manifested in her ability to channel and manipulate mana with precision, lending an added effectiveness to her use of Mana Force.

Additionally, Ethan acknowledged that Emily's unique perspective and approach to magic played a significant role. She possessed a keen intuition and an inventive mind, constantly seeking new ways to optimize her magical abilities. Her willingness to experiment, combined with her adaptability and resourcefulness, allowed her to uncover techniques and strategies that amplified the power of Mana Force.

"I guess this is a matter of skill that you don't have," Emily shrugged while smiling.

"I will sue you for copying my words," Ethan said. "Now that I think about it, you have to pay me for my lessons, right? One hundred thousand per lesson should suffice."

"You said that you didn't want money!" Emily shouted.

In the end, Ethan enjoyed making Emily think that she had a debt of a few million for a while. Regardless, now she didn't have to bother him and could focus on her training alone… Still, she called him for the simulator once again.

"What for? We just achieved our goals," Ethan said.

"It will be better if we work together to motivate each other," Emily said.

"I don't need motivation; I am plenty motivated to train on my own," Ethan said. "Show me your motivation! Now I am motivated! I need more power!"

"You try really hard to be cringe…" Emily said, and then Ethan received a message, and soon after, Emily also received one.

"It is from Hannah; I hope that she isn't asking me to buy ice cream or something," Ethan said.

"She also sent me a message," Emily said.

"I don't like this; time to bail," Ethan said and then prepared to dash home, but instead of being teleported home, he appeared in the underground facility where Hannah worked.

"You didn't read my message… where do you think you are going?" Hannah asked with her arms crossed right in front of Ethan.

"I have piano lessons waiting for me now if you will excuse me," Ethan said.

"You can't even play Rock Band or Guitar Hero, now way you can play piano," Hannah said, and then Emily appeared soon afterward.
