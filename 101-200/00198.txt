Chapter 198 Focus

That didn't make any sense… Everyone knew that Ethan had crazy powers and skills, but others had them as well, and their sources had a real explanation. Emily, for example, was good with elemental magic because she received the blessings of the elements along her journey in the other world by contacting some families that had high magical powers.

In any case, Ethan reached into his inventory and pulled out a bag of marshmallows, along with a compact griller. His eyes gleamed mischievously as he surveyed the surroundings, searching for a suitable spot to indulge in a simple pleasure amidst their journey.

Emily, Dante, and Aline exchanged amused glances, clearly finding Ethan's choice of culinary delight rather unexpected in the midst of their adventure. They had a myriad of thoughts and comments racing through their minds, ready to burst forth. However, they decided to hold their tongues, intrigued to see what Ethan had in store.

With deftness born from practice, Ethan set up the griller and arranged the marshmallows on skewers, preparing for a traditional campfire treat. The flickering flames cast a warm glow on their faces, creating an intimate ambiance despite the gravity of their mission.

After filling his belly, Ethan began to sleep. It looked like he was on vacation. Emily Wondered if he would act like that if his sister had made him the leader of the mission.

"Is he always like that?" Aline asked. "I had heard rumors and there was that time where we fought during the mission on Ghana, but this is way worse than I had imagined. Birds of a feather, I guess."

"Pretty much. Soon you will realize that his serious and laid-back mode are too far apart, so don't get surprised when that happens," Emily replied.

Emily and Dante exchanged glances, their expressions reflecting a shared realization. They had always known Dante to be serious, focused, and driven, but now they couldn't help but wonder if their perception had been slightly misguided.

Dante's eyes twinkled with a newfound appreciation as he observed Ethan's unwavering dedication and his ability to maintain composure even in the face of adversity. He had seen Dante's steadfastness and strength. Still, now he questioned whether there was another side to him, a depth of seriousness that they had yet to fully grasp.

The group took turns in watching the area, but the island was completely safe, even though there were krakens swimming around. Around the time Ethan woke up, Dante also called everyone since it was about time for Hannah to teleport them back to hear their report.

Hannah stood at the command center, anxiously awaiting the arrival of the group. Her heart had been weighed down by worry ever since they embarked on their mission, but now that she saw them approaching unharmed, a deep sigh of relief escaped her lips.

As the team members entered the command center, their tired but determined expressions gave Hannah a glimmer of reassurance. She listened intently as they began their report, detailing their encounters, challenges, and triumphs along the way.

Hannah's eyes flickered with a mix of concern and curiosity as she absorbed the information. Each word painted a vivid picture in her mind, and she couldn't help but feel a surge of admiration for their resilience and resourcefulness. The dangers they had faced and the obstacles they had overcome were not lost on her.

"You all made some commendable progress," Hannah said while looking away and thinking apparently about something else. "I will ask you all to keep up with the good work, but you all should stop if you find their location. We don't know how they will react once they find you, so it is better to be careful just in case."

Everyone nodded. Ethan thought that their presence should already have been noticed, considering how cautious and annoyingly resourceful Ian was. Still, there were other things around that could have masked their presence, like the krakens.

The group soon returned to the other world and then kept resting until it got dark. Time passed slowly since they didn't have anything to do or talk about. Still, Ethan used that chance to increase his Mana Force level.

"While I learned a useful skill, I didn't get that stronger since the last mission," Ethan thought. "I guess I should focus more on recovering my memories."

Ethan sat cross-legged on the floor, his eyes closed in deep concentration. He took slow, steady breaths, allowing his mind to quieten and his body to relax. Meditation had become a regular practice for him, not only for its calming effects but also as a means to recover his lost memories.

However, as Ethan delved deeper into his meditation, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The process of unlocking his memories was not without its challenges. Each time he ventured into the recesses of his mind, it was like unearthing buried fragments, piece by elusive piece. And with each memory that resurfaced, there was a ripple effect that affected his emotions and mood afterward.

Ethan understood the importance of recovering his memories. But he also knew that the journey would not be easy. Memories, like fragments of a shattered mirror, could reflect both joy and pain, happiness and sorrow.

"Well, let's see what will happen today…" Ethan thought.
