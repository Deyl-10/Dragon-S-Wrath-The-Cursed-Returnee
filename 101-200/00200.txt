Chapter 200 Facing

As the group made their way through the rugged landscape, they finally stumbled upon Ian. His presence was unmistakable, accompanied by an eerie and ominous aura that sent shivers down their spines. His gaze had an undeniable intensity, his features twisted with annoyance and frustration.

Ian's posture betrayed his displeasure as he made no attempt to hide his annoyance at their arrival. The air around him crackled with a palpable tension, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere that enveloped the group. Things looked worse than they expected, Ian wasn't there to play around.

Emily, Dante, and Aline exchanged wary glances, their expressions mirroring the unease that had settled upon them. Ian's demeanor, so different from the person they once knew, fueled a mixture of concern and apprehension within them.

His intense aura seemed to radiate an unsettling energy, casting shadows on their once hopeful mission. The group hesitated, unsure of how to approach him in his current state. They were well aware that confronting Ian would be no easy task, as his anger and frustration were palpable, permeating the air around them.

"What is wrong, Ian?" Ethan asked. "Got dumped by Lyla, and now you decided to join the dark side?"

As Ian exuded an unsettling aura and his annoyance hung heavy in the air, the rest of the group couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation. A collective gulp traveled through their ranks as they braced themselves for what lay ahead. The tension in the atmosphere seemed to thicken, leaving them on edge.

However, to everyone's surprise, Ethan appeared unfazed by Ian's demeanor. His carefree and audacious nature refused to bow down to the oppressive atmosphere. Instead of succumbing to fear, Ethan decided to taunt Ian with his usual nonsense in a characteristic display of his lighthearted nature.

The group watched with a mix of astonishment and concern as Ethan, with a mischievous grin on his face, began to unleash a series of witty remarks and sarcastic quips. His words floated in the air, seemingly defying the weight of the situation.

"... I am not in the mood today, so I am going to tell you this just once. Leave now," Ian said.

"This is perfect; you are going to live a day in my life where someone annoying is always bothering you!" Ethan said while smiling. "Lady fate is a cruel mistress, don't you think? Anyway, let's start this for real… cough, cough. You are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. One will be provided for you if you cannot afford an attorney. Do you understand these rights?"

Ian's exasperated sigh resonated through the air, filled with a mix of irritation and disappointment. His brow furrowed as he struggled to comprehend Ethan's nonchalant attitude at such a critical moment. The weight of the situation seemed lost on Ethan, who persisted in his jests and lighthearted banter.

Ian's gaze bore into Ethan, a subtle mix of frustration and impatience dancing in his eyes. The gravity of their mission, the stakes at hand, and the imminent danger surrounding them demanded a more serious approach. To Ian, Ethan's jokes appeared to undermine the severity of the situation, causing an internal conflict within him.

I think you should take a look at

With a heavy heart and a flicker of resignation, Ian realized that Ethan's demeanor was unlikely to change. Their personalities clashed, and it seemed that Ethan's carefree nature would persist even in the face of adversity. Ian understood that they each had their own ways of dealing with stress and tension.

"Hey, Ethan… stop with this," Emily said. "You know what his goal is."

"What about it?" Ethan asked. "If I have robbed a bank with the intention to donate the money to hungry children, don't I have to answer for my crimes?"

Emily's brow furrowed as she listened to Ethan's words. Deep down, she couldn't help but feel a tinge of discomfort at the realization that he was right. The gravity of Ian and his family's actions began to weigh heavily on her mind. It was undeniable that they had trespassed into another world without proper authorization, utilizing its resources, lands, and technology for their own purposes, all without informing or seeking consent from anyone.

As someone who believed in abiding by rules and protocols, Emily found it difficult to overlook the severity of these transgressions. The implications of their actions reached far beyond personal motivations or noble intentions. These were serious crimes that could have far-reaching consequences, not only for Ian and his family but also for the delicate balance between different worlds.

A sense of responsibility washed over Emily as she contemplated the potential ramifications of these unauthorized ventures. She couldn't ignore the fact that innocent lives and livelihoods might have been affected by Ian's actions, whether directly or indirectly. The weight of the situation settled upon her, causing her to question the moral boundaries that had been crossed.

"If you don't react properly, this is no fun," Ethan shrugged. "Anyway, I am not the leader here. What do you want to do, Dante?"

"... First, I want to hear from the people involved their intentions, goals, and actions," Dante said after he stepped forward.

Ian sighed. Ian's annoyance simmered beneath the surface as he observed the group's reaction to his predicament. He couldn't help but feel frustrated that they seemed more focused on the consequences of his actions rather than understanding the motivations behind them.

He had expected a certain level of understanding from his friends and a willingness to see things from his perspective. Yet, their immediate judgment and lack of empathy only served to fuel his annoyance. It felt as though they were quick to pass judgment without considering the complexities of his situation.

"Very well, you will have what you want," Ian declared and then glared at them. "You will face the troubles that you have caused to me."
