Chapter 191 [Bonus ]

Hannah showed up again, and then she began to teleport the others in front of him. It didn't take long for Emily and Aline to hiss at each other… one could only guess why they would accept to work together. Women are a mystery that humanity will never truly understand.

"Thanks for accepting the invitation," Dante said. "It will be easier to find them with people that know Ian and his family."

"That is a pity; I guess you called the wrong people for the job," Ethan said. "The only thing that I know about Ian is that he is annoying, that his sister is a brat, and his father acts like a mafia boss. By the way, don't thank us, you owe us one."

"Umm, sure," Dante said. "Anyway, I hope we can work well together."

Ethan couldn't help but ponder over the sudden change in Dante's demeanor. Their first meeting had been filled with tension and conflict, leaving a sour impression on both of them. Yet now, Dante seemed unusually polite and accommodating. It raised questions in Ethan's mind, stirring his curiosity about the true motives behind Dante's behavior.

As they followed Hannah's lead, Ethan and the others found themselves guided through the facility toward a teleportation room. The room held a mysterious air, its purpose and connection to Ian's house intriguing and shrouded in secrecy.

"Another reason for this mission to start so late is due to the fact that we didn't find vestiges of a Teleportation spell being used at their home," Hannah said. "However, we analyzed a bit of the vestige of mana and found that it was the same as the samples that we have of another planet that we know of."

"How is that planet connected to Ian and his family?" Ethan asked.

"It isn't; there is no data that says that they had been there," Hannah replied.

"What can you tell us about them?" Ethan asked. "Anything that you think that they might find worth hiding from everyone."

Hannah observed Ethan intently, her eyes tracing his every move and expression. His probing questions and logical reasoning had struck a chord within her, stirring a mix of intrigue and concern. While his inquiries held merit and made sense, Hannah couldn't ignore their troublesome implications.

As Hannah delved deeper into her contemplation, she noticed the rest of the group catching on to her hesitation. Their gazes shifted between her and Ethan, silently acknowledging the weight of the situation. The air grew heavy with unspoken thoughts and uncharted territory.

Ethan's relentless pursuit of answers had brought them to this point, unearthing a web of mysteries that demanded careful consideration. Hannah knew that their next steps held the potential for significant consequences, and her role as the voice of caution weighed heavily upon her.

"Ivan Morris, until one year ago, was a successful businessman that had many fishing boats," Hannah explained. "However, all of a sudden, both of his kids suddenly went to other worlds. Around that time, many kids began to disappear, and some panic began to spread. Ivan and his wife worked together to find traces of their kids, but Ivan's wife had a heart problem. The anxiety and fear for her kids eventually made her fall ill and pass away. Three months later, both of their kids returned, and he changed his business to focus on technology, and he made contacts with many people that were related to returnees. Thanks to that and the fact that his daughter had unrivaled alchemy skills, he became worldwide famous."

"Only the things about his wife seem like the thing that they would try to hide," Ethan shrugged. "When I worked with them, I realized that their goals were a bit weird. Anna was studying herbs and other things, apparently to create a special potion. I never confirmed that, but I assumed that it was a potion to revive the dead."

A hush fell over the room as Ethan's words hung in the air, sinking into the minds of his companions. The revelation that Ian and his family might be harboring plans to revive his mother with a potion struck each of them like a bolt of lightning, leaving them stunned and speechless.

Wide-eyed and mouths agape, the group exchanged incredulous glances, their minds grappling to comprehend the gravity of what they had just heard. The implications of such a bold and risky endeavor reverberated through their thoughts, intertwining with their existing concerns about Ian's sudden disappearance and the enigmatic circumstances surrounding his family.

The weight of the revelation settled upon them, casting a shadow of uncertainty and apprehension. The very idea of tampering with life and death, of attempting to revive a loved one through unconventional means, was both intriguing and unsettling. It called into question the boundaries of ethics, the consequences of playing with forbidden knowledge, and the potential ramifications that could ripple through their own lives.

"I won't say that is impossible or that it is insane, but…" Hannah hesitated. "Well, knowing about a possibility won't help much. I will send you all to the world that we assume that they are. I can't say where they went, so you will have to work hard to find vestiges of them."

"What if the vestiges that they left were just a fake trail to fool anyone that might try to investigate their actions?" Ethan asked.

"That truly seems like something that Ian and his father would do," Emily furrowed her eyebrows.

"We will eventually confirm or deny that; for the time being, just focus on searching for traces of them in that world," Hannah said. "It isn't a place that I have been before, but it isn't that dangerous anymore."

In a distant realm, a world plagued by oppression and tyranny, a summoned hero emerged with unparalleled strength and a relentless spirit. This hero, who eventually became known as the Brawler, possessed unrivaled combat prowess and an unwavering determination to bring justice to a realm on the brink of destruction.
