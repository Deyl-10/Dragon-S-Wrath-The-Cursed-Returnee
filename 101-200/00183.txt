Chapter 183 Alone, At Least

When Emily first heard that Ethan's powers were connected to his memories, a peculiar sensation washed over her. It was a feeling that something was off, something that didn't quite fit the mold of her understanding of magic. Memories, after all, were personal and intimate, tied to one's experiences and emotions. The notion that they could be intertwined with supernatural abilities seemed strange, almost absurd.

She couldn't help but wonder how such a connection could exist. Memories were fleeting, ephemeral fragments of the past, while magic was a force that transcended time and space. How could something as intangible as a memory fuel and shape powers beyond the realm of understanding?

As these thoughts swirled in her mind, Emily's curiosity grew. She found herself drawn to the enigma that surrounded Ethan's powers. It was as if a new puzzle had presented itself, and she yearned to unravel its secrets.

"I never heard of a technique like that… all the spells that I know are more direct, attack, defense, and support," Emily said. "Besides, I never heard of such a state as over mana."

"Well, they are both parts of the same technique. Ethan explained that you can learn one, but it is useless since you need to maintain the focus to keep the mana from dispersing," Ethan explained. "I think that is the case; I can't say for certain."

"It is quite weird to talk with you like that," Emily furrowed her eyebrows.

In any case, lessons started, so they stopped talking. When the lessons were over, Ethan checked for messages, but Ian didn't reply to them.

"What a coward…" Ethan muttered. "Your time will come, wash your neck."

"Hey, sorry about yesterday; we didn't have time to say goodbye," Kei said after he approached Hana. "We couldn't risk staying away from our rooms for much longer."

"No problem," Ethan said. "My sister thinks that it is better to keep what we did as a secret since the higher-ups might see us as unruly."

"Part of the problem was solved, but we didn't find any signs of those three," Hana said. "There is also the issue about the guys who caused the dungeon breaks… it seems that from now on, things won't be peaceful anymore."

Peace, with its tranquility and calm, seemed desirable on the surface. It offered a respite from the chaos and allowed for a sense of harmony to prevail. However, Ethan also recognized that peace could sometimes conceal people's true nature and intentions.

On the other hand, conflict has a way of bringing out the best and worst in individuals. It acted as a crucible, testing their abilities and revealing their true character. In times of struggle and strife, people's strengths and weaknesses became evident when faced with challenges. Competence and resilience would shine through, while those who lacked the necessary skills would falter.

Ethan saw the conflict as a means of unmasking individuals, separating the pretenders from the genuine ones. It brought clarity to people's motives and unveiled their true colors. In times of turmoil, when tough choices had to be made, the facade of benevolence could no longer hide ulterior motives.

While everyone was worrying about that, Ethan kept sending messages to taunt Ian. He sent things like: Looks like we've got a little scaredy-cat hiding in the shadows. I heard they had a sale on bravery, but it seems you missed out, huh? Calling you a coward would be an insult to actual cowards everywhere. I bet your bravery is stored in a tiny little vial labeled 'for emergencies only.

"For the love of Odin… stop sending messages to Ian," Emily said and then sighed. "I want to test that thing that you said. Can you come to the simulator with me? Maybe you can recall a few things and give me some pointers."

"What is in it for me?" Ethan asked.

I think you should take a look at

"Do you need even more reason to spend time with a cute girl like me?" Emily asked.

"... Bruh," Ethan showed. Are you for real expression.

"I was just joking; I can pay you," Emily said.

"Do I look like some kind of host for adult entertainment?" Ethan asked. "Well, I don't have anything better to do, so I guess it is fine."

"Ethan is savage, huh," Hana said while furrowing her eyebrows.

"A true man in search of true gender equality," Kei added. "Do you mind if we join you?"

"No problem, it is actually a good idea since that will make Ian feel left out when he returns," Ethan said.

"You sure can hold a grudge…" Emily said.

Those four went to the simulator and then chose the free mode. Now that Ethan thought about it, they didn't have to be there, even more so when their conversations were being recorded, but it was the best place to train.

"It has been a while since I learned any spell; I should work on that," Ethan thought.

Emily took a deep breath and settled herself into a comfortable position. She closed her eyes, focusing her thoughts on the surging mana within her. With each breath, she attempted to channel and absorb the excess energy, hoping to strengthen her own powers.

However, despite her best efforts, the mana eluded her grasp. It slipped through her fingertips like water, refusing to be harnessed. She felt a sense of frustration welling up within her, but she remained determined.

Emily continued to meditate, trying different techniques to align herself with the abundant mana. She visualized it flowing into her, picturing herself as a vessel capable of containing its power. Yet, no matter how hard she concentrated, it remained just out of reach.

"You can't just try to absorb the extra mana; you need to make it overflow through your body and then eventually take your time absorbing it," Ethan said. "I think.".

"Why would anyone listen to the opinion of someone who always says, I think, in the end?" Emily asked.

"What is this training for?" Hana asked.
