Chapter 195 Beyond The Ocean

Everyone nodded, and then they began to chase the creature while running as fast as the wind. Emily seemed a bit bothered by the fact that her rival's skills apparently reached a new level, but she tried to hide her feelings. Few people can learn Mana Force, so she probably felt a bit less bothered because of it.

In any case, the group kept moving North for several hours, and they crossed four hundred kilometers before Aline's mana ended, and she had to take a break to recover a bit.

"How pathetic," Emily said and then tossed a bottle of high-quality mana to Aline.

"You are finally making yourself useful. You can keep doing that by carrying my backpack," Aline smirked.

"Hey, let's focus on the mission," Dante said and then sighed. "We are arriving in an unexpected area, so we don't have time for bickering with each other."

As the group ventured further into the cold and desolate region, a sense of isolation enveloped them. The landscape stretched out before them, barren and unforgiving, with only patches of vegetation dotting the otherwise desolate terrain. The air felt crisp and biting, sending shivers down their spines.

Despite the absence of signs of civilization, the group's eyes caught a glimmer of light in the distance, emanating from the eastern horizon. It flickered like a distant beacon, offering a faint glimmer of hope amidst the desolation. Curiosity sparked within them as they realized that it might be a sign of life or perhaps a settlement nestled amidst the harsh surroundings.

"You two were informed of several things about this world, right?" Ethan asked. "What are we going to find ahead?"

"Nothing… just the ocean," Dante replied. "This whole area was supposed to be the border between the empire and its first neighbors. Since the end of the war, it has been abandoned."

"How long has passed inside the war?" Ethan asked.

"Six months for us, five years for the people of this world," Dante replied.

Twelve years…, considering that the terrain in the opposite direction wasn't that rich in mana and minerals, their neighbors didn't need to expand their territory. Regardless, it was useful to know that the flow of time there was ten times faster."

"Wait a minute, if the flow of time is ten times faster here, then Ian and his family had passed through this place two and half months ago," Ethan furrowed his eyebrows.

I think you should take a look at

As the group stood in the presence of the flickering lights, a shared realization washed over them, reflected in their exchanged glances. It dawned on them that Ian and his family had likely been in this other world for a far longer duration than they had initially anticipated. The weight of this revelation settled upon their shoulders, tinged with a mix of concern and curiosity.

Yet, despite the length of time Ian and his family had spent in this world, the fact that their goals remained unfulfilled added a layer of uncertainty to the path that lay ahead. It served as a reminder that the challenges they faced were not easily overcome, and success was not guaranteed.

"I guess they are using the flow of time here to finish their preparations…" Dante rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "There is not a single thing in this world that is of interest to them, in theory, so they want the flow of time."

"I don't think that is that accurate, they certainly wanted the flow of time on their side, but only because they wanted to prepare for as long as they could," Ethan declared. "Anyway, we should continue heading North until we find the ocean or something else."

The group began to move again, and soon, the smell of the ocean filled their nostrils. As the group ventured further along the desolate landscape, the soft whispers of the ocean reached their ears, beckoning them toward its mysterious depths. The darkness of the night embraced them, adding an air of intrigue to their surroundings. And then, as if emerging from the shadows, they finally arrived at the shore, greeted by the vast expanse of the ocean stretching out before them.

Moonlight bathed the tranquil waters, casting a mesmerizing glow that danced upon the waves. The rhythmic sound of crashing waves resonated through the night, harmonizing with the distant calls of nocturnal creatures. The serenity of the scene was punctuated by the gentle breeze that carried the salty scent of the sea, creating an atmosphere of both tranquility and anticipation.

The group stood in awe, their gazes drawn to the endless horizon where the dark waters met the starry sky. The immensity of the ocean sparked a sense of wonder within them, reminding them of the vastness of the world they had entered and the boundless possibilities that lay beyond.

"What do you know about the underwater monsters of this world?" Ethan asked.

"Not one bit; we didn't expect that we would have to cross the ocean," Dante explained. "According to the Intel that we have, this continent is insanely large and houses all the people in the world; sea exploration had yet to happen in this world."

"This seems like something that Ivan would know and would decide to use as well," Ethan said. "Anyway, we can't wait until morning, so we should cross it once we confirm that the others are ahead."

As Aline called upon the spirit of the wind once again, her voice carried a sense of command and reverence. The air around her seemed to shimmer with a subtle energy as she focused her will. But this time, she channeled a different aspect of the elemental spirits, summoning the spirit of ice to aid them in their journey.

Aline's incantations grew in intensity, resonating with the frigid essence of the spirit she called forth. Suddenly, a chill filled the air, causing a thin layer of frost to form on the ground beneath their feet. The temperature dropped, and a soft, ethereal light illuminated the surroundings, reflecting off the crystalline ice.
