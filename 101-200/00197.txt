Chapter 197 Unlimited Inventory Works

The Kraken let out a primal roar, a mix of anguish and rage, as it struggled against the overwhelming power coursing through its immense body. The shockwaves from the electricity reverberated through the water, sending ripples cascading across the darkened surface.

You learned the skill Swim.

The Skill Swim obtained 10.000 experience points.

…

Ethan didn't have the skill, and now it reached level thirty in no time… it seemed that the monster had a lot of time to level up that skill, it was only obvious.

Regardless, Ethan did some tests, using mana to attack and steal the experience by touch. None of them affected each other. Ethan also tried to control his curse by covering his body with the mana, but nothing changed. Before long, the beast began to sink since its brain was fried up.

"I guess I need more data," Ethan thought once he jumped backward and landed on an iceberg.

"That was weird of you," Emily said. "What were you doing?"

"Just some experiments," Ethan replied while he was cleaning his hands. "In any case, didn't you say that you could sense the traces of the same mana you felt before?"

"... I thought that we were close, but the feeling didn't change," Aline said while looking away. "I guess I fell for a trap."

"Ian is a moron, but he is smart as well when he needs to be," Ethan rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "This is also something that they planned for months, so it goes without saying that we would find some difficulties."

"I suppose they made the entire once into a giant barrier… finding them will be the same as finding a needle amidst hay," Dante said. "While I was chosen for this job, I don't have much experience chasing those who fight with the skills that Ian has."

"Let's head East for now," Ethan said. "This kind of trick usually has a maximum range, and considering the mana that Aline can feel, we can say that something is emitting the same readings in a large area; this something must be at the epicenter of the spell. Once we find some of the dimensions of this trap, we can guess where the epicenter is."

Nods of agreement rippled through the group, silently communicating their shared understanding. They recognized the need to remain vigilant and prepared for whatever lay ahead, knowing that there were yet mysteries to unravel and dangers to confront. Still, Ian and his family could have only prepared so much for them.

After enduring a few hours of relentless travel, the group gradually found themselves moving beyond the range of the great spell that Ian and his family had ingeniously devised. The lingering effects of their diversion began to wane, allowing their presence to fade from the scrutiny of those who might seek to track them.

The surroundings began to change as well. The landscapes shifted, revealing new vistas and unexplored territories that lay beyond the boundaries of the great spell. No longer confined to the confined spaces and deceptive illusions.

I think you should take a look at

"The mana is back to normal, but it seems that the diversion spell has several hundred kilometers of radius," Aline said while showing a complicated expression. "Even if we head in the right direction, there is a chance that we won't find them."

"There is another way that we can use to find the epicenter of the spell," Ethan said.

"There is?" Aline asked.

"Oh, I get it… while the spell envelopes a large area, it can only reach so high in the sky," Emily nodded several times. "The atmosphere and the mana of the environment also affect the range of the spell in terms of its height. We just have to fly above the spell area and then find its highest point. That will be right above the epicenter."

Dante and Aline nodded since that made sense. Still, the sun did they not know if it was the right time to continue with their journey. They were a bit tired as well, so it was good to take a break. They were in the middle of the ocean, though.

"Let's look for an island to take shelter; we need to take a break," Dante declared.

"Teenagers nowadays aren't like they used to be," Ethan shrugged.

"I guess it makes sense that you, of all people, would say such a thing," Emily shrugged as well.

As Aline summoned the spirit of Earth, a powerful energy filled the air, and the ground beneath their feet trembled. The spirit emerged, standing tall with a rocky exterior adorned with intricate patterns. It exuded strength and stability, embodying the essence of the Earth itself.

The group's attention was drawn to an island ahead, appearing like a precious gem amidst the shimmering waters. The island boasted towering cliffs that rose from the shoreline, their jagged edges accentuated by crashing waves. Lush vegetation covered the island, with tall palm trees swaying in the gentle breeze, offering shade and solace.

Crystal-clear streams meandered through the landscape, reflecting the vibrant colors of the surrounding flowers. Exotic blooms added bursts of color, infusing the air with a delightful fragrance. The island seemed untouched by time, a haven of tranquility and natural splendor.

Ethan brought some rope hammocks from his inventory and then jumped in one of them before he tied it up to some coconut-looking trees.

"And you are the first to relax… it is weird that you use such a useful thing like an inventory like that," Emily furrowed her eyebrows.

"It is fine. It does have an unlimited space, after all," Ethan shrugged.

"I heard of some people that have them, but it is never unlimited," Dante said.

"Maybe you just never used to store many things," Emily said.

"One day, I used to store the armor and weapons of an army of fifty thousand," Ethan said. "It was equivalent to five hundred tons."
