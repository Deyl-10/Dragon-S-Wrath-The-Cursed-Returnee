Chapter 184 Groundbreaking

Ethan concluded his silent explanation with a nod. Hana and Kei exchanged a glance, their eyes speaking volumes. Uncertainty mingled with intrigue, their minds wrestling with the possibility of unlocking new depths of power. Could such a technique indeed exist? Was it within their reach?

In that shared moment of unspoken wonder, the three companions embarked on a silent journey of exploration. They would experiment, observe, and test the boundaries of their own abilities, driven by a newfound determination to uncover the truth behind Ethan's explanation.

"That is some groundbreaking stuff…" Kei said while thinking about what Ethan said. "I think I heard of a similar technique in another world, but only legendary beasts could do that. They learned that after leaving for thousands of years."

"I heard of dragons that can grow stronger by absorbing the mana from the monsters they eat. Naturally, their mana pool increases as well," Kei said. "They are extremely dangerous since they can become world-destroying calamities, and they have been mostly hunted to extermination in most worlds."

"That is pretty boring. I heard that the stronger they are, the tastier they become," Ethan said. "Can you imagine how gourmet the meat of a world-destroying dragon is?"

"I don't know how good it would be, but the price to raise one would be too high," Emily said. "Anyway, keep an eye on me and then say what you think I should do or change."

Ethan began to watch Emily while he was lying down while copying the sleeping Buddha. At the same time, he wondered what kind of spell or technique he should learn next. He felt like all of his bases had been covered, but he also felt that he didn't have any real weapons.

"I don't feel her mana increasing at all; it seems that most people don't have the same benefits I enjoy from Mediation," Ethan thought. "Still, she has ten times more mana than me."

Emily's level didn't seem that high, so it felt like something was off. Trying to understand other people's strengths using his system also didn't seem accurate.

"Try to create a layer of mana around your whole body like you are using Neutral Enchantment," Ethan said.

"Neutral Enchantment? Seriously, it feels like every single thing you do and says is to make others don't listen to you," Emily said when she finally realized the position that Ethan was in.

"You sure like to nag, and you are doing that a lot more than usual," Ethan said and then sighed. "Neutral Enchantment is like this. You enhance your attack or a body part to attack and cause more damage."

Although that wasn't supposed to be possible, Emily could see the mana around Ethan's arm, and so she tried to copy it. Even Emily had a hard time covering her arm with it for some reason, but she pulled off after one hour.

I think you should take a look at

Ethan's mind raced as he pondered a new idea. What if he could use his mana to boost all of his abilities at once? It was like activating all the buffs he had encountered but in a unified way. The thought excited him, as it meant he could increase his strength, speed, and intelligence simultaneously.

His eyes lit up with the possibilities. He imagined a surge of mana flowing through his entire body, amplifying his physical and mental prowess. The image of an all-encompassing aura, radiating power and potential, flashed in his mind.

The concept seemed too good to be true, and he wondered if it was even possible. Could he truly cover himself in mana and become an unstoppable force? Still, it wasn't his current goal.

"Just using the buffs won't work since that will consume mana; I can't use mana if my plan is to enter that stage of over mana," Ethan thought while imagining ahead how the technique would work. "Using mana, without using it… controlling it without giving purpose, this is quite hard."

Such a technique would come in handy in the long run, but Ethan rarely used magic, so it wasn't something that he actually needed.

Ethan turned his head and caught a glimpse of Kei and Hana engrossed in deep meditation. Their curiosity about the technique he had just explained was evident in their focused expressions. It pleased him to see their genuine interest and determination to explore new possibilities.

Kei sat with his legs crossed, his hands resting on his knees as he closed his eyes. His face displayed a calm and serene composure, reflecting his inner focus. Ethan could sense Kei's strong desire to unravel mana manipulation's secrets and enhance his abilities.

On the other side, Hana adopted a similar posture, her palms placed gently on her lap. Her brow was slightly furrowed, indicating her concentration. Ethan admired her unwavering dedication and thirst for knowledge, knowing that she was driven by the same hunger for growth that fueled his own ambition.

Although Emily had a hard time learning Neutral Enchantment, she had an easy time expanding the energy around her body. Her skills and talents sure were whimsical at the weirdest of times. Still, Ethan could understand.

Emily stood before her friends, surrounded by a delicate shimmering veil that encased her like a thin layer of glass. The magical barrier, barely visible to the naked eye, emitted a soft and ethereal glow, casting a gentle radiance upon her features.

As the light danced and flickered across the surface of the enchantment, it created an illusion of fragility, like a fragile membrane that separated Emily from the outside world. Yet, within that fragile appearance lay an incredible strength, as if the translucent barrier held immense power waiting to be unleashed.

The magical layer appeared seamless, adhering to Emily's form like a second skin. It clung to her with an otherworldly grace as if it were an extension of her very being. The intricate patterns within the enchantment seemed to shift and swirl, reflecting the depths of her magical essence.
