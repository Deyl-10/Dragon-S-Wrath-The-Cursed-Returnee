Chapter 177 Collapse

Ethan, determined and quick on his feet, faced a barrage of icy arrows unleashed by his enemies. With a massive number of solid punch, he shattered each arrow that came his way, sending them into icy oblivion. It was as if his fists were hammers, pounding away at the frozen projectiles.

But Ethan's defensive maneuvers didn't end there. As his adversaries closed in, charging with relentless intent, he tapped into a surprising trick up his sleeve. Seizing the opportunity, he snatched two enemies, their memories now in his possession, and hurled them toward each other like ragdolls caught in a hurricane.

The stolen foes collided in a comical and chaotic spectacle, crashing into each other with a resounding thud. Their charge was halted, their momentum disrupted, as they grappled with the unexpected collision. The sight of their own allies crashing into one another left the remaining enemies momentarily bewildered, creating a temporary opening for Ethan to reclaim control of the battlefield.

When things got tough, Emily fired a wave of water toward the enemies and then used a cold wind to freeze their legs. She managed to avoid Ethan while she was doing that, so he was really thankful.

"Almost there… done," Nuvian said.

A sudden, unmistakable sound filled the air as Nuvian focused his powers on undoing the magic barrier surrounding the portal. It was like the cracking of a giant piece of glass.

The sound started quietly, like a faint rumble, but quickly grew louder and more intense. It was a sound that made everyone's hair stand on end as if something massive was about to break apart. The cracking noise continued to escalate, each fracture echoing sharply and sending shivers down everyone's spines.

The sound became more pronounced with every passing second, reaching a point where it seemed impossible to ignore. It was as if the very fabric of reality itself was straining and about to give way. The cracks grew more chaotic and unpredictable, occasionally accompanied by small pops and snaps.

As Nuvian unraveled the magical barrier encasing the portal, a distinct change swept over the blue enemies. Their once-calm demeanor transformed into a savage frenzy, propelling them toward Ethan with greater ferocity than ever before.

With an air of unbridled aggression, they charged toward Ethan, their movements wild and untamed. Gone were the cautious strides and measured strikes; now, their actions were filled with a raw, primal determination to vanquish their adversary.

The intensity in their eyes burned like a raging fire, urging them to close the distance with an unrelenting fervor. Their approach became a blur of motion, a whirlwind of uncontrolled energy as they closed in on Ethan.

Their attacks became more brutal, fueled by an insatiable thirst for victory. They abandoned caution, launching themselves at Ethan with reckless abandon, caring little for their own safety. It was as if their very existence depended on overpowering him.

"It is fine to hurry up, brother-in-law," Ethan said while looking at his red and pale fists, thanks to the blood and ice.

"Extend your arms," Emily said and then made Ethan's arm be covered by the earth in the same massive gauntlets, but then it was absorbed. "Your weird power is really annoying."

I think you should take a look at

"Just heal my wounds and buff me with some basic support magic," Ethan said.

When Ethan was healed, he couldn't help but wonder. Healing magic was also mana that was used to cover his body or some parts, so why didn't his curse absorb the mana before it could heal him. The buffs of Emily also weren't absorbed… It was weird.

"It is time now," Ethan thought when his mana was full again.

Using all of his mana, Ethan used all of his buffs alongside Neutral Enchantment. In the next moment, he made his fingers pierce the ground and then grabbed it like it was a massive boulder before throwing it at the enemies.

"That will smash them!" Emily shouted.

"So noisy…" Ethan said and then jumped and punched the forty meters tall boulder.

As if called upon by an invisible force, a shower of icy stones rained down upon the enemies, pelting them with a relentless barrage. The air filled with the sound of countless stones colliding with the ground and the adversaries' bodies, creating a cacophony of impacts.

The ice stones, like a torrential downpour, descended upon the foes with a force that sent them sprawling. The sheer number of stones overwhelmed the enemies, causing them to stumble and lose their footing amidst the onslaught.

The scene resembled a frenzied hailstorm, with the icy stones acting as the agents of chaos. They rained down upon the enemies, disrupting their advance and sowing confusion within their ranks. The battlefield became a battleground of fallen adversaries; their attempts to stand were met with the unyielding force of the ice stones.

"Hehehe, I will can this attack… frozen go to sleep," Ethan said and then saw some of the enemies getting up already. "Nuvian, how much longer?"

"Thirty seconds," Nuvian replied.

Things were looking up; it would be good if that were the case. Ethan knew from the beginning that leaving that place would be a pain in the ass under those conditions. The best option would be to cross the portal and close it from the other side, but that wasn't possible since the origin was on their side, so they had to close it from that side and then return to the starting point while being chased by a massive army of enraged blue soldiers. That wasn't the best of ideas… so Ethan had a plan of his own.

With a fierce determination in his eyes, Ethan delivered a powerful punch to the ground, unleashing an overwhelming force that shook the entire cave. The impact reverberated through the air, causing rocks to loosen and the cave's foundation to quake. Things were starting to look more than a little bit serious, but In that situation, Ethan couldn't act in any other way.
