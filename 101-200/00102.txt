Since those skills leveled up a few times, in the end, Ethan managed to hit the bull's eye one time on his first day of practice, but that came with a price. The muscles of his arms and back were sore as they could be, and Ethan had hurt almost all the fingers of his right hand.

"Ask for the old man heal your hands," Catty said before picking the bow and arrows, and then she left.

So far, his Isekai adventure hadn't been like Ethan had envisioned. He had a leveling-up system, and he was using it somewhat, but the standard way would be for him to kill slimes and level up like crazy… in any case, Ethan couldn't complain. He just headed silently toward the library of the castle, where he met Lucius. Although he asked nicely for him to heal his wounds, the old man instead tried to teach Ethan how to cast Heal. Ethan obviously failed, but the old man tried to use the pain Ethan felt as fuel to teach him, but he failed. The current Ethan, on the other hand…

"This skill really doesn't make any sense… it feels so easy learning things here, and leveling them up is also pretty straightforward."

For an old man, Lucius wasn't that patient, so he ended up healing Ethan's hands since the smell of blood was permeating in the library. In any case, it took a while longer for Lucius to lose all the patience. After all, everyone had a specialty, and perhaps Ethan was the same. Still, in the end, Lucius gave up on Ethan after trying to teach Ethan all basic spells of each class and element and failing. He, who was looking for a reason to return to his homeland due to war, found in Ethan, the perfect scapegoat. In the end, he left a letter saying that he couldn't withstand the treatment he was receiving in the castle and that he had never had such a pathetic student in so many years. That was just a bunch of excuses, but it worked well for Lucius in the end. For a while, since he died a few days after.

In the end, after relieving those memories a single time, Ethan managed to learn two of the spells Lucius tried to teach him. The damn old man used him as a scapegoat, but he wasn't that good at teaching. Even a fifteen-year-old girl was better than him. Regardless, even though for his ultimate purpose, which was to fully control his power as an Omni Hero, it would be better to focus on the little magic training he had in Hedo, Ethan decided not to do that. Too many weird things had been happening since he returned, and he couldn't ignore the other aspects of his powers. Ethan would need to recover the strength he once had, hence, the necessity to train his body again and other skills he didn't quite master, like the few things Catty and other individuals taught him.

After reliving that day a few more times, Ethan managed to learn a few more spells, and he leveled up the skills he already had. When he opened his eyes again, it was already morning, and the sun was rising.

"As expected, this skill is as useful as always. It always helps me save a lot of time. Now with this… hopefully… I will be able to keep those dreams in check."

Although it wasn't that comfortable to stay in that state for several hours, by doing so, Ethan could skip his sleeping hours. It wasn't a good idea to use Zen to train and rest his body every single day, but he wasn't going to die if he kept doing that for four or five days straight. Regardless, it was an excellent way to make use of his powers and keep the information about himself well hidden. Still, some individuals would notice that Ethan didn't just meditate for an entire night. One of them was Emily. After she left her tent, she immediately noticed that Ethan's presence had grown stronger, magically speaking.

"You are a really weird warrior," Emily frowned. "I never saw a warrior that had more mana than stamina."

Ethan just shrugged since Nuvian had said something similar to him a few days ago. Regardless, little by little, Ethan was recovering the strength he once had, and he also mastered the skills he had never managed to get before. Still, even though he worked pretty hard, he and his allies didn't manage to clean even half of the area around them. Since that area was rich in mana, monsters like treants could multiply at an astonishing speed. So, Ethan was forced to go home, and Emily and Ian were also returning to Earth since they had to attend school. Ian didn't look like the type who would worry about his presence, so he definitely was going to do something else.

Before leaving, Ethan watched the Clannian people training with the crossbows he gave them. They improved a little bit in the last few days, but they still had a long way ahead of themselves. Still, if they concentrate their attacks in a single direction, their individual skills wouldn't matter.

"My father and Anna are going to stay behind, so you don't have to worry," Ian said. "Do you really think the mercenaries would try to do something while someone who intends to take down an entire army of monsters by themselves is nearby?"

"The hell are you talking about?" Ethan asked. "I was thinking that their individual skills don't need to grow in the end, only their confidence."
