Chapter 196 Kraken

And then, as if materializing from the wintry mists, the spirit of ice appeared before them. It took the form of a majestic figure, tall and slender, adorned in shimmering ice-blue garments that billowed like frozen wisps in the breeze. Its hair was a cascade of glistening icicles, and its eyes gleamed with a glacial brilliance, reflecting the depths of the frozen world.

With graceful movements, the spirit of ice floated ahead of the group, its presence exuding a serene power. As it glided effortlessly over the surface of the ocean, the water beneath its touch turned to a glistening sheet of ice, extending in a straight line along their path. The frozen pathway provided a stable and secure footing, allowing the group to traverse the otherwise treacherous terrain with ease.

Dante had a hard time keeping his feet from slipping in, but once he copied Ethan, who was sliding with perfection.

"Are we that close to the destination for you to use this much mana?" Emily asked.

"I can feel the mana again; you have gotten dull if you didn't realize it until now," Aline said.

"... Are you sure that it is coming from the same source?" Emily asked while furrowing her eyebrows.

"Either way, we need to be alert, don't use too much mana, Aline," Dante declared.

As the group ventured deeper into the unknown, an air of ominous foreboding settled upon them. The once serene and tranquil surroundings began to transform, casting an eerie shadow over their path. The chilling breeze whispered hauntingly through the air, sending shivers down their spines.

The darkness of the ocean stretched out before them, its inky depths seeming to swallow all light that dared to approach. The rhythmic sound of crashing waves against the icy shoreline became an eerie symphony, echoing through the silence. The absence of any signs of life added to the unsettling atmosphere, as if the void had swallowed the very essence of existence.

With each step they took, the weight of the darkness seemed to press upon their shoulders, weighing them down with an unexplained heaviness. The occasional flicker of distant lights on the eastern horizon only served to intensify the eeriness of their surroundings. It was as if those lights were beacons of some hidden truth, yet they remained just out of reach, teasing them with their elusive presence.

"... Something is coming," Ethan suddenly said when he suddenly felt a small vibration on the ice path. "Be ready for battle and to end it quickly since the commotion might cause more monsters to come."

The ground trembled beneath their feet as a massive column of water shot into the air, accompanied by a deafening roar that pierced through the eerie silence.

From the chaos of the explosion emerged a monstrous creature, a giant Kraken of unimaginable size. Its immense tentacles thrashed through the water, creating a turbulent whirlpool that threatened to engulf everything in its path. Towering over the group, the Kraken's sinister presence loomed large, its body covered in glistening, iridescent scales that shimmered in the moonlight.

Its eyes, dark and menacing, held an ancient wisdom that spoke of untold power and malevolence. The creature's tentacles, lined with rows of suckers, writhed and coiled with a deadly grace, their sheer size capable of crushing even the sturdiest of ships.

Ethan summoned his sword, but before he could do anything, Dante used his and fired a lightning bolt through it that paralyzed the beast. He jumped in the air, and then when an earth platform appeared behind him, he kicked with all his might and flew like a bullet toward the beast… in the next moment, he passed through the head of the creature and killed it.

Before he could fall into the sea, Aline created another earth platform and then used it to bring Dante back to the ice path.

"Is it fine to use that much mana?" Ethan asked. "You don't look like the type who has much to spare."

"I have some tricks up my sleeve," Dante explained and then sheathed his sword. "It is better than letting the fight drag out and alert others nearby."

"It would make sense if your lightning bolt didn't do that already," Ethan said while shrugging since the previous attack had been pretty flashy.

Dante looked around, realizing that he had caused quite the flash of light and the noise had also been loud as well. In any case, they began to move, and soon Aline got tired again… instead of making her ice spirit create a path, she made the creature create some icebergs here and there, and they used it to jump around. Despite being a mage, and summoner, Aline had enough physical strength to cross fifty meters in a single jump. As for Emily, she kept flying without a care.

Half an hour later, Aline's mana had emptied, and the group stopped. Before long, Another Kraken showed up to attack them.

"Leave this to me," Ethan said and then jumped toward the creature.

The beast tried to smash Ethan with two tentacles and aim at him from the sides, but he just swung his sword in an arc and repelled them. The tentacles trembled since Ethan enhanced his sword with Electric Enchantment.

Before long, Ethan landed on the head of the monster and made his sword pierce it, and then he used Electric Enchantment.

The electric currents converged upon the Kraken's writhing mass, enveloping its body in a web of electrifying energy. The creature convulsed and trembled, its massive form jerking uncontrollably as the electricity surged through its very being. Each tentacle, once a formidable threat, now quivered with a mixture of agony and fury.

The luminous sparks danced along the Kraken's scaled surface, casting an eerie glow upon its monstrous frame. The electric shocks disrupted its movements, causing its tentacles to flail and thrash with a lack of coordination. The once indomitable force of the ocean now found itself at the mercy of the powerful electrical assault.
