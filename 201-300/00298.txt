Chapter 298 Final Battle (10)

Once formidable in its own right, the Omni Armor now radiated a brilliant aura, crackling with arcane energy. It enveloped Ethan, becoming a testament to his unwavering determination and the risks he was willing to take for the sake of their mission.

Ethan could feel the power coursing through his veins as the enhancements took hold. He could sense the armor's connection to his very essence, responding to his will with heightened responsiveness and strength. It was a double-edged sword, a gamble that had the potential to tip the scales in their favor or plunge him into peril.

The Demon King, realizing Ethan's newfound strength, abandoned any notion of delay and unleashed his devastating attack sooner than anticipated. With a menacing glare, he channeled his dark energy into a concentrated force, preparing to unleash a cataclysmic assault upon Ethan and his allies. The air crackled with malevolence as the Demon King's power surged, the impending danger hanging heavy in the atmosphere.

In a flash of motion, the Demon King unleashed his attack, dark energy surging forth with terrifying force. The destructive power surged toward Ethan, threatening to overwhelm him with its sheer intensity.

In a moment of profound realization, Ethan's attention snapped to his friends, his heart pounding in his chest as he witnessed a colossal beam of destructive energy hurtling toward them from the heavens above. Without a second thought, he sprang into action, propelled by a surge of protective instinct.

Ethan positioned himself in the path of the colossal beam, his body braced against the impending impact. A deafening roar reverberated through the dimension as Ethan intercepted the colossal beam of energy. The impact was cataclysmic, causing the very fabric of the realm to tremble in response. The force of the collision unleashed a blinding explosion of light, engulfing everything in its brilliant radiance.

In that blinding moment, the world around them faded away, consumed by the overwhelming brightness. The vision was obscured, leaving everyone momentarily disoriented and vulnerable. The sheer intensity of the light seared into their consciousness, momentarily robbing them of their senses and leaving them in a state of temporary blindness.

When the light vanished and the smoke caused by the explosion dispersed, everyone saw Ethan floating in the air, and they sighed in relief. Meanwhile, his enemies stood frozen in a state of profound shock. Their expressions morphed from arrogance and confidence to disbelief and astonishment as they witnessed the magnitude of Ethan's sacrifice.

Their faces contorted with a mixture of fear and awe, the realization dawning upon them that they had underestimated the depths of Ethan's resolve. In that fleeting moment, their certainties were shattered, replaced by a newfound awareness of the unwavering determination that burned within him.

Despite that, Emily realized that something was off… an attack of that level shouldn't have been easily blocked… Ethan absorbed a lot of the energy, and that was energy directly powered by chaos…

"That idiot… Ethan! Don't overdo it!" Emily shouted. "Even if you can control your power, it doesn't mean that it won't affect you if you are only fueled by the chaos that you absorb."

A collective gasp escaped the lips of Ethan's comrades as a realization settled upon them like a heavyweight. Their eyes widened with shock and concern as they comprehended the danger that Ethan willingly put himself in. The implications of absorbing attacks of such immense magnitude became clear, and a ripple of fear coursed through their ranks.

In the midst of battle, they witnessed firsthand the toll it took on Ethan's being. The strain was evident, and the notion that he might become a vessel for the chaotic energies that they fought against sent a shiver down their spines. They understood the risks inherent in his actions and the potential consequences that could await him.

Ethan was fully aware of the dangers, but he couldn't hold back now… in the end, he had already accepted the risks a long time ago. Besides, he didn't want to die or live, knowing that he didn't do his best there.

Without any hesitation, Ethan turned to face the enemies in front of him, and they got clustered together to protect the cloaked figures even more. As Ethan soared through the air, his determination burning brighter than ever, the four generals of the Demon King formed a protective shield around him. They braced themselves, ready to defend against any threats that may arise, their expressions a mix of vigilance and resolve.

But in a shocking twist, Ethan's figure suddenly vanished from their sight, leaving them momentarily bewildered. Before they could comprehend what had happened, a wave of dread washed over them as they felt an ominous presence behind them. Their eyes widened in horror as they turned to face Ethan, only to find him standing there, a sword in hand, and their bodies beginning to fall apart into sliced fragments.

A mixture of disbelief and terror filled their eyes as they witnessed the devastating aftermath of Ethan's swift and precise attack. Their defenses had been rendered futile against his uncanny ability.

A chilling sense of horror overtook the Demon King as he beheld the swift and effortless defeat of his loyal underlings. His eyes widened in disbelief, and a deep-rooted unease settled within his very being. The confidence he once exuded now wavered, replaced by a haunting realization of the formidable adversary that stood before him.

In the depths of his haunted gaze, the Demon King recognized that the tides had turned against him. The horror that settled upon him mirrored the impending doom that loomed over his once-unassailable empire. The knowledge that he stood defenseless against the relentless onslaught of Ethan's power brought forth a chilling realization—the end of his reign was drawing near.

"I said sorry before, but I guess I was pretty stupid… I was really down in the dumps," Ethan said. "This time, I won't say sorry. How about this: so long. Or how about this one: surprise motherfucker?"
