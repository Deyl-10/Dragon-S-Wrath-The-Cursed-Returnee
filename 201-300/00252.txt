Chapter 252 Ice Age

Ethan found himself torn between two competing ideas, both vying for his attention and consideration. On the one hand, he had an idea that held great potential, something that could potentially change the tide of their battles and provide his allies with a significant advantage. On the other hand, he was aware that pursuing this idea would require him to leave his allies alone for a period of time, which could leave them vulnerable and unsupported.

The notion of leaving his comrades behind was not an easy one for Ethan to grapple with. He valued their trust and camaraderie, and the thought of abandoning them in their time of need weighed heavily on his conscience. He understood the risks involved in venturing off on his own, potentially leaving his allies exposed to danger and uncertainty.

"Ethan, we are going to fight all out," Dante added. "Holding back isn't an option."

"Fine by me," Ethan shrugged.

As the group neared the enemy's base, the tension in the air was palpable. They knew that the time for action had come, and they needed to execute their plan with precision and unity. At a distance of five hundred meters from the enemy's stronghold, they looked at each other. Then they split up, each member taking on a specific role and direction.

Ethan and Dante split up, each taking a different side of the enemy base. As they assumed their positions, a surge of power coursed through their bodies. Dante tapped into his survivor's instincts, honed through years of dangerous encounters. His senses sharpened, and his strength intensified as adrenaline surged through his veins.

Ethan tapped into his inner fury, unleashing the power of Berserker and Lightning Armor. His eyes blazed with a fierce determination, and an ominous aura surrounded him, crackling with dark bolts of lightning. The air around him grew heavy with a sense of impending doom as he channeled his rage into his attacks.

With Lightning Armor enveloping him, Ethan became a formidable force on the battlefield. The armor crackled with raw energy, enhancing his speed, strength, and reflexes. Before the enemies could realize what had happened, Ethan crossed their camp in the blink of an eye and killed dozens of vampires.

Ethan became a blur of black lightning, moving with unparalleled speed and agility through the enemy's base. His presence was fleeting, a mere flicker in the darkness, as he traversed the battlefield unseen. The enemies caught glimpses of the crackling black lightning, but they could not comprehend the true nature of the force that was tearing through their ranks.

With each swift movement, Ethan struck with deadly precision, dispatching his foes with lightning-fast strikes. His black lightning illuminated the chaos around him, revealing the carnage left in his wake. The enemies stood in bewilderment, unable to anticipate or react to his lightning-quick movements.

Dante's eyes widened in shock and awe as he witnessed Ethan's incredible display of power and speed. The sheer ferocity and precision with which Ethan moved through the enemy camp left Dante in awe. He realized that Ethan's skills and abilities far surpassed what he had initially expected.

As he watched Ethan effortlessly dispatch multiple foes in an instant, Dante couldn't help but feel a mix of admiration and determination. He knew that he had come a long way since joining Ethan's journey, but witnessing Ethan's prowess served as a reminder that he still had much room for growth.

"No time to hide or hold back," Dante muttered while showing a serious expression.

Dante didn't like to use that since he returned to Earth, but he decided to use his main skill.

With a swift motion, Dante swung his sword in a wide arc, cleaving through the air with incredible speed. The sheer force of his swing carried his blade forward, slicing through the enemy ranks as if they were mere paper.

To the astonishment of those witnessing his feat, Dante's sword struck with such precision and power that even the enemies several meters away were caught in its path. The momentum behind his swing seemed to defy the laws of physics, enabling him to reach and decimate his foes with lethal accuracy.

As Dante's blade cut through the air, a shockwave of energy emanated from the impact, causing the ground to tremble beneath him. The sheer force of his attack sent enemies flying, their bodies severed in two as if they were mere playthings.

Aline watched in astonishment as Dante unleashed his true powers, his swordsmanship cutting through enemies with unparalleled precision and force. She knew Dante to be a reserved and humble individual, someone who preferred to keep his true abilities hidden from others. To witness him displaying such incredible skill and strength was a surprise to her.

Aline had seen glimpses of Dante's potential during their battles together. Still, she had always sensed that he held back, refraining from fully revealing the extent of his capabilities. It was a part of his nature, a trait that made him enigmatic and intriguing. She respected his decision to keep his true powers concealed, understanding that he had his reasons for doing so.

"We need to help… we can't let them do everything," Aline said.

"We were told to help when the enemies were to attack us," Emily said.

"They won't with those two nearby; panic is spreading around the enemies like wildfire," Aline said. "They were ultimately humans, they weren't born vampires, so they still have some human traces behind. They never faced enemies like those two. Mary, use your Frozen Breath for as long as you can."

"... Okay," Mary said, still feeling reserved, thanks to the vampires.

Mary began to use her Frozen Breath, and the temperature around her began to decrease even more. In the meantime, Aline used her wind spirit to control the cold of the area and circulate around the enemy's camp… as if that wasn't enough, Emily began to condense the snow clouds in the sky and make them move downward.
