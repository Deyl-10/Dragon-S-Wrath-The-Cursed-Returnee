Chapter 275 Echoes

As Ethan shared the power level of the demons they were about to face, a wave of concern washed over the group. Their expressions shifted from curiosity to worry, realizing the immense challenge that awaited them. The sheer magnitude of the demons' power was difficult to comprehend, and it weighed heavily on their minds.

Ethan himself couldn't help but feel a sense of unease because he knew that facing the demons was no small feat, and the thought of Anna and Mary, young and inexperienced, going up against such formidable foes filled him with a mix of protectiveness and apprehension. These were battles that should be fought by seasoned warriors, not by children.

"I will make quick work of them and force them to give some answers," Ethan thought.

As the weight of the impending battle and the mystery surrounding the demons burdened their minds, Ethan contemplated the possible avenues to find answers. While research and investigation were valuable, he recognized that time was of the essence. The quickest path to gain critical information might be to confront the enemies directly and force them to reveal what they know.

Ethan understood that facing the demons head-on would be dangerous and challenging. Still, he believed it was a risk worth taking. By engaging the enemy in battle, he could potentially capture and interrogate them, coercing them to reveal vital information about their motives, weaknesses, and the overall situation they found themselves in.

He knew that extracting information through force was not a gentle approach. Still, given the gravity of the threat and the urgency to protect their world, Ethan felt compelled to push boundaries. He recognized that this method might not yield all the answers, but it could provide valuable insights that could guide their next steps.

Before long, the group felt Aline's presence approaching, and from that direction, they saw some flashes of light on the horizon. It seemed that Dante was holding back the enemies, but only for now.

"Thank you for coming, everyone…" Aline said while showing a tired expression. "We need to think of something to help Dante."

As a sudden shiver ran down Ethan's spine, he instinctively activated his Lightning Armor, enveloping himself in crackling electricity. His senses heightened, and he swiftly scanned the surroundings, searching for the source of danger. Just as his gaze locked onto a distant point in the sky, a beam of ominous purple light surged toward the group with alarming speed.

Reacting with lightning-fast reflexes, Ethan propelled himself upward, soaring through the air to intercept the deadly blast. He positioned himself directly in its path, his body charged with electrical energy, creating a barrier of crackling lightning that absorbed and deflected the oncoming cannon of purple light. The impact resonated with a resounding explosion, causing the air to ripple with raw energy.

As Ethan descended from his elevated position in the sky, the aura of lightning dissipating around him, he gradually slowed his descent. The intense energy that surrounded him began to fade, leaving behind trails of wispy steam that rose from his body. The air around him seemed to tremble with residual power, carrying the remnants of his formidable display.

When his feet finally touched the ground, Ethan wobbled slightly, his muscles still tense from the exertion. The strain of the recent encounter was evident on his face, beads of sweat glistening on his brow. His breathing was steady but slightly labored, a testament to the immense energy he had been hit by.

"It seems that he already found me…" Ethan said.

"The demon king?" Emily asked, visibly shocked.

"Yes… This proves it; he is the real deal, the same that I killed," Ethan said.

As the dust settled and the echoes of the demon king's attack lingered in the air, Ethan's mind raced with realization. The intensity of the demon king's assault and the sheer force behind the attack all pointed to one undeniable truth: it was the same enemy he had faced and vanquished in the past.

The depth of the demon king's animosity towards Ethan was unmistakable. It was a hatred forged through battle and bloodshed, a testament to the impact Ethan had made on their previous encounters. An imposter, no matter how cunning, would not harbor such intense emotions or possess the same level of familiarity with Ethan.

In that pivotal moment, Ethan's mind sifted through the memories of their previous clashes, connecting the dots and piecing together the puzzle. The demon king's relentless pursuit and unwavering determination to eliminate Ethan made sense now. The bond of enmity between them had not been severed; it had only intensified over time.

As another spear of menacing purple light hurtled towards Ethan, his instincts kicked in, and he swiftly activated his newly acquired Frost Armor. The icy aura enveloped him, reducing the impact of the attack and shielding him from its full force. The collision between the frigid barrier and the spear sent shards of ice scattering in all directions, and Ethan could feel the intense cold seeping into his bones.

The fact that his Frost Armor had managed to mitigate the power of the attack gave Ethan a glimmer of hope amidst the chaos. It was a small victory, but a victory nonetheless. It confirmed that his relentless training and pursuit of new abilities were bearing fruit.

However, as the echoes of the clash subsided, Ethan's mind buzzed with a multitude of questions. But with one leading the charge, how had the demon king managed to return after Ethan had seemingly defeated him before?

"I suggest you guys to keep a distance," Ethan said. "I will face him again, and in the meantime, you should offer assistance to Dante. We can't afford to let a single monster leave this area."

With determination etched on his face, Ethan soared through the turbulent skies, leaving his allies behind. His decision to face the demon king alone was not born out of arrogance but rather a strategic calculation. By diverting the attention of half of the enemy forces towards himself, he aimed to create a favorable situation for his companions.
