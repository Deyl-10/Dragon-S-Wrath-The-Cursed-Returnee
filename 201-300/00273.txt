Chapter 273 Teaming Up

Demi-tyrants, the hybrid beings born from the fusion of humans and dragons, were extraordinary creatures that defied conventional boundaries. Engineered through a fusion of scientific knowledge and arcane magic, they embodied the formidable strength and majestic essence of dragons while retaining the humanoid form.

Unlike their full-blooded dragon counterparts, Demi-tyrants lacked the ability to fly. Their wings, a vestige of their draconic heritage, were mere reminders of their origins rather than functional appendages. Nevertheless, the absence of flight did little to diminish their power and resilience.

The strength of Demi-tyrants was unrivaled among mortal beings. Their physical prowess surpassed that of ordinary humans, granting them enhanced strength, speed, and agility. Their heightened senses allowed them to perceive the world with exceptional clarity, and their endurance allowed them to endure punishing battles with resilience.

Physically, Demi-tyrants stand taller than the average human, their imposing figures reaching heights of eight to ten feet. Their muscular frames exude strength and power, each movement radiating an air of controlled might. The fusion of dragon and human traits is evident in their features.

Their skin, although resembling that of humans, often carries a faint sheen akin to the lustrous scales of dragons. These scales can vary in color, ranging from deep shades of crimson, emerald, and sapphire to more subdued hues of bronze, silver, and gold. The scale patterns are unique to each individual, much like the intricate designs found on dragon wings.

"The other army is equally troublesome," Hannah said. "They are a bunch of crazy demons, and they have a demon king as well. His name is Drag'drath."

As the name of the demon king echoed through the air, a profound shift occurred in Ethan's demeanor. The once calm and composed aura surrounding him transformed into an intense and foreboding energy, causing a ripple of shock and surprise among his companions.

Eyes widened, and jaws dropped as they witnessed this sudden transformation in Ethan's presence. His previously steady and controlled aura now radiated an overwhelming power, tinged with a mixture of determination and unease. It was as if a dormant force within him had been awakened, revealing a side of Ethan they had never witnessed before.

Ethan's eyes widened, reflecting the tumultuous emotions swirling within him. His brows furrowed, and his lips parted slightly as he processed the significance of what he had just heard. The implications of his connection to the demon king seemed to weigh heavily on his mind, threatening to unravel the delicate balance he had maintained until now.

In that moment, time seemed to stand still for Ethan. His gaze remained fixed, searching for answers that eluded him. At the same time, his mind raced to comprehend the magnitude of the revelation. The shock etched onto his face was a testament to the depth of the realization and the impact it had on his understanding of himself and the challenges that lay ahead.

"... Are they from the world that you saved?" Hannah asked.

"Yes… The demon king Drag'drath was the last guy I killed back there," Ethan replied. "That guy is no joke. Give him enough time, and he can sink the whole continent, and he hates me enough to do so without any hesitation."

"... They appeared four hours ago; how much time do you think he needs to do that?" Hannah asked. "He didn't make any move until now, so I am imagining that he is preparing his attack."

"With all his mana, he can easily destroy an area equal to a state," Ethan replied. "He will need one more hour to use the same kind of attack."

As the weight of Ethan's description of the demon king sank in, a collective gulp resonated through the group. The gravity of the situation became palpable, and the enormity of the threat they faced sent shivers down their spines. The mere thought of a being possessing such immense power and destructive potential left them feeling small and vulnerable.

The image painted by Ethan's words seemed to evoke a sense of awe and terror simultaneously. The demon king appeared to be a force of nature, an unstoppable entity capable of wreaking havoc on an unimaginable scale. The implications of confronting such a being were daunting.

Gulps turned into deep breaths as the group steeled themselves, their expressions reflecting a mix of determination, apprehension, and a spark of defiance. They understood the immense challenge that awaited them. Still, they were resolved to stand united against the looming darkness, ready to face whatever trials lay ahead.

"... Anyway, do we have any guesses as to why those guys are back?" Emily asked, trying to change the subject a bit. "That certainly will help solve the situation, it will also help calm down our nerves a bit... this kind of tension isn't something I was expecting to feel after returning to Earth, after all."

"Not yet… we are too busy trying to keep the situation under control," Hannah replied and then let out a sigh. "Anyway, I will be sending you all to help Dante and Aline soon since that group is the most troublesome one in our continent. We should get something after that.""

As the conversation turned towards the most troublesome group of enemies in their continent, a shadow seemed to pass over Ethan's face. The mention of this particular faction reminded him of the grim reality that they were just one piece of a much larger puzzle. While their focus had primarily been on the enemies within their own region, it now dawned on Ethan that similar threats likely existed in other continents as well.

The thought unsettled him. It meant that their current struggles were merely a fraction of the overall conflict that raged across the world. If there were formidable adversaries in their own continent, it was highly likely that other continents faced similar, if not more dire, situations. It painted a picture of a world torn apart by chaos, with countless lives at stake and untold battles being fought in the shadows.
