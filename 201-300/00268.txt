Chapter 268 Special Monsters

At that moment, Ethan's focus was entirely on helping his friend recover. His mind momentarily set aside the enigma surrounding the monsters' presence in Orlando as he channeled his energy into ensuring Emily's well-being. The elixir's healing properties provided a glimmer of hope amidst the darkness that loomed over the city.

"The poison and the wound are gone, but it damaged your spirit. You should retreat," Ethan said. "I will ask Hannah to send you to her base."

"No… I had to fight for my hometown," Emily said. "This is my fault… my presence here is probably what makes it possible for the link between that world and Earth."

Ethan's eyes widened in surprise as he absorbed the weight of those words. The idea that the presence of summoned heroes could be the very link connecting Earth to other worlds, potentially leading to countless deaths, sent a shiver down his spine. It was a realization that struck him with a mix of shock and confusion.

He couldn't help but ponder the implications of such a connection. The thought of Earth being intertwined with multiple worlds, each with its own set of dangers and conflicts, was both overwhelming and alarming. The consequences of this connection were now apparent in the form of the monsters ravaging Orlando.

Questions flooded Ethan's mind. How had this link been established? What purpose did it serve? And most importantly, what could be done to sever or control it? He realized that unraveling this mystery was crucial not only for the safety of Earth but for all the worlds connected to it.

"Our mana and presence create a link between worlds since most of the origins of our powers are aliens," Emily said. "Anyway, we can talk about this later. We need to save the city."

He couldn't help but agree with her point that saving the city should take precedence over divulging their discoveries. The immediate danger and the lives at stake demanded their urgent attention.

As much as Ethan desired to share the information they had gathered, he understood the practicality of prioritizing the current crisis. The people of Orlando were in dire need of assistance, and revealing the truth about the interconnected worlds could wait until they had secured the safety of the city.

Ethan's eyes widened in alarm as he heard the rumble of a collapsing building behind him. Quickly turning his gaze, he was met with a sight that would send a shiver down anyone's spine. Before him stood a colossal creature, a monstrous amalgamation of a dinosaur and an armadillo, unlike anything he had ever encountered before.

The creature towered over the surrounding structures, its massive frame reaching heights of nearly thirty meters. Its scaly, armored body was a combination of earthy browns and grays, blending in with the rubble-strewn cityscape. Sharp, jagged spikes lined its back, offering an intimidating display of defense.

The beast's ferocious head was adorned with rows of razor-sharp teeth jutting out from its powerful jaw. Its eyes glowed with an intense and primal hunger, fixated on its surroundings. Enormous claws, capable of rending steel and concrete, extended from its limbs, leaving deep gouges in the ground with each step.

As the creature moved, its heavy footsteps reverberated through the air, causing tremors that further destabilized the already devastated city. Ethan could feel the sheer force and power emanating from the creature, an overwhelming presence that demanded attention.

"I thought you had an easy time since you only fought against monsters in your world, but I guess I was wrong," Ethan thought.

A monster able to knock down three stories tall buildings wasn't a joke, so Ethan couldn't joke either. Without wasting time, he used his lightning armor to approach the best and then flew to behead the monster.

Ethan swung his sword with all his might, aiming to sever the neck of the colossal monster before him. But to his surprise, the blade only managed to make a shallow cut, barely grazing the creature's thick, armored hide. The impact sent reverberations through Ethan's arms, causing him to momentarily stagger back.

Confusion and frustration washed over Ethan as he assessed the situation. The creature's defenses were far more formidable than he had anticipated. Its armored scales proved to be a formidable barrier, resisting even his most powerful strikes. It was clear that this opponent was no ordinary foe.

Grim determination settled on Ethan's face as he realized that he would need to devise a new strategy to overcome this daunting challenge. He couldn't rely solely on his physical strength and swordsmanship to defeat such a resilient adversary. Perhaps there were weaknesses or vulnerabilities that he had yet to discover.

"I was able to cut down those massive robots… so how the hell is this thing that sturdy?" Ethan furrowed his eyebrows.

"Ethan! They are special monsters that get stronger the more they kill, but they use their souls to make themselves stronger and sturdier each time!" Emily shouted. "If you keep attacking, it will work eventually!"

Ethan never heard of that kind of creature before, and the world he had been sent to certainly had all kinds of creatures... he wondered what kind of environment they grew up to become like that, but he didn't have time tot think about that. It was time for the clean up.

The colossal monster unleashed a devastating swing of its tail, aiming to crush Ethan under its immense weight. In a calculated move, Ethan braced himself. He accepted the attack, knowing that the impact would trigger the release of the souls trapped within the monster's body. The ground shook violently as the monster's tail crashed down, sending shockwaves reverberating through the surroundings.

The force of the impact was tremendous, pushing Ethan down to the ground with tremendous force. The sheer power of the attack threatened to overwhelm him as he struggled to maintain his footing. The asphalt beneath his feet shattered and cracked, spreading out in a web of destruction for dozens of meters.
