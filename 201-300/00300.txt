Chapter 300 Final Battle (12)

With each clash of their weapons, a spectacle of unparalleled force unfolded. Ethan's strikes met the Demon King's fists head-on, their impact causing explosions of energy that sent shards of the enemy's flesh scattering in all directions. The power behind each blow was overwhelming, leaving no doubt as to the ferocity and determination with which Ethan fought.

The force of the attacks echoed through the battlefield, their intensity reverberating in the air. Piece by piece, the Demon King's flesh was torn asunder, his form unable to withstand the relentless barrage. The enemy's once-imposing presence waned as each impact from Ethan's blade chipped away at his power and resolve.

As Ethan unleashed his lightning-fast strikes, the sheer speed and precision of his attacks surpassed human comprehension. To the casual observer, it appeared as though the Demon King's form was suddenly peeled apart, layer by layer, like an egg. The seamless flow of Ethan's movements made it impossible to discern individual strikes, leaving only the aftermath of destruction in their wake.

With each strike, the Demon King's defenses crumbled, unable to withstand the relentless onslaught. The force and speed of Ethan's swordsmanship peeled away the layers of the enemy's form, exposing the vulnerable core beneath. The visual spectacle was one of swift devastation as if the Demon King's very essence was being laid bare.

"Ugh…" the demon king groaned while his body was screaming in agony.

In that brief moment of weakness, Ethan beheaded the enemy without any hesitation.

Ethan turned and then saw the giant monsters approaching his friends. Without a hint of hesitation, he flew around the area and attacked the surviving enemies from behind. He usually disliked killing others from behind, but he decided to make an exception that day.

"They are coming," Ethan said with an extremely grave voice. "Prepare yourselves."

As Ethan's transformed appearance came into view, a wave of surprise washed over his companions. The stark contrast between his previous hero-like visage and his current form, veiled in an ominous aura, left them momentarily taken aback. The sudden shift in his appearance evoked a sense of uncertainty and unease within the group.

The sight of Ethan's transformed appearance created a dissonance among his allies. They grappled with conflicting emotions, torn between their unwavering trust in him and the unsettling aura he now exuded. The change challenged their preconceived notions of heroism, forcing them to confront the complex nature of the battles they faced.

The cloaked figures were nowhere to be seen, so Ethan assumed that they were inside the giant monsters and controlling them.

"Why do you wish to fight us? We are only working to restore balance," The four cloaked figures said, their voices coming out from the interior of the giant monsters.

"You can restore balance somewhere else; don't involve Earth when your balance requires the destruction of our lives," Ethan said.

"Balance has to be absolute in all parts of the cosmos," The cloaked figures said in unison. "Only the worlds affected by your actions are unbalanced. The other parts don't require our intervention."

"Well, what can I say… our planet sure is messed up already. We don't need your help to make things more chaotic," Ethan said. "I am sure that humans are stupid enough to be able to cause problems to each other. You can just watch from the sidelines."

"That sure doesn't sound like the speech of a hero," Emily said.

"I never claimed that it was one," Ethan shrugged.

The giant monsters, despite their chaotic nature, possessed a semblance of intellect. They observed Ethan and his friends with a calculating gaze, attempting to decipher the motivations behind their actions. In their own twisted way, they sought to comprehend the reasoning and purpose that drove the group's unwavering determination.

However, their attempts at understanding proved futile. The monstrous beings were bound to the chaotic forces that fueled their existence, rendering them incapable of fully grasping the selfless resolve and unwavering unity exhibited by Ethan and his companions. Though they possessed some semblance of rational thought, their chaotic origins obstructed a complete understanding of the group's intentions.

"Your words and actions don't make any sense. You all need to be destroyed for the sake of the balance,"

"I am used to not being understood… The story of my life," Ethan shrugged.

Ethan didn't know what enemy was the most dangerous there, and he didn't have time to choose one to attack first since all three of them attacked at the same time.

The giant reptilian monster, fueled by its chaotic nature, unleashed a devastating blast of dark energy, hurtling towards Ethan and his companions with destructive intent. The pitch-black energy crackled with malevolence, threatening to engulf them in its consuming power. Simultaneously, the four-legged silver creature focused its gaze, emitting lasers of intense energy from its eyes, slicing through the air with deadly precision.

The four-legged silver creature, with its alien-like appearance, possessed formidable abilities of its own. Its piercing silver eyes glowed with an eerie brilliance as it unleashed a barrage of laser beams, each one cutting through the air with lethal precision. The beams carried a destructive force, capable of piercing through even the strongest defenses and leaving devastation in their wake.

As if orchestrated in perfect unison, the bird-like creature enveloped the group in a field of gravity, locking them in place and impeding their movements. The oppressive force pressed upon them, making every step and action a struggle against the invisible gravitational hold. The combined assault of the three creatures demonstrated their formidable capabilities and their intent to subdue their adversaries with overwhelming force.

Ethan moved to the spot where he was hit by the dark cannon and the lasers, and while he didn't feel the weight behind the attacks, he felt his very being melting due to the attacks… his Omni Armor wasn't working at all.

"What the hell…" Ethan muttered while groaning in pain.
