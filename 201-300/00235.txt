Chapter 235 Here We Go Again

As he observed the young girl, he noticed her petite stature and delicate frame. Her short, chestnut-brown hair framed her face, falling in gentle waves. Her large, expressive eyes held a hint of both innocence and trepidation, darting around the room before settling on Ethan. It was evident that she was overwhelmed by the situation, flinching slightly when their eyes met.

"... Who the hell was the genius that assumed that it was a good idea to choose a brat like her to become a summoned hero at a time like this?" Ethan thought.

"It is all right, Mary," Hannah said. "Everyone here is a friend that is going to help you. No need to worry. The most dangerous person here is my little brother, and the only thing that he might do is to make you feel like you are losing brain cells thanks to his nonsense."

Ethan wanted to deny that, but he couldn't. He truly believed that his nonsense could make people more stupid.

Ethan's heart sank as he noticed Mary's demeanor and the telltale signs of a child who had experienced bullying. Her avoidance of eye contact and constant downward gaze spoke volumes about the struggles she had endured. It was clear that she had become accustomed to keeping her guard up, shielding herself from potential hurt and disappointment.

Beyond the marks of bullying, Ethan couldn't help but sense a deeper pain within Mary. There was a weight in her presence, an unspoken burden that seemed to weigh heavily upon her young shoulders. He couldn't shake the feeling that she carried the weight of family problems as well, that her home life might be far from idyllic.

Ethan's own experiences with hardship and adversity allowed him to empathize with Mary's situation. He understood the lasting impact of bullying and how it could shape a person's self-perception. He also knew the toll that family troubles could take on a child's well-being.

"We don't know what we will find on the other side, so we must be ready for everything," Dante declared. "Mary will be summoned at nine o'clock, and Hannah will send the rest of us with her by using the residual mana of her summoning. We have half an hour until then. Use it as you see fit."

As the group gathered in the room, everyone dealt with the nervousness and anticipation in their own ways. Emily decided to pass the time by practicing her Mana Force abilities, creating dazzling displays of magic to occupy her mind.

On the other hand, Ian remained silent and deep in thought, his gaze fixed on the corner of the room. It was clear that he was lost in his own contemplations, perhaps reflecting on past experiences or mentally preparing for the challenges ahead.

Noticing Mary's obvious nervousness, Dante and Aline took it upon themselves to engage her in conversation, trying to make her feel more comfortable. They tried to ease her anxiety and create a welcoming atmosphere with friendly smiles and reassuring words. They wanted Mary to know that she was among friends who genuinely cared for her well-being.

"I heard about what you talked about with Dante last night. I think it would be better if you were to follow the orders of someone older and more experienced. Still, I can see where you see coming from in this situation," Hannah suddenly said. "Much to my surprise as well, it seems that your offer is being analyzed with great interest, but you need to show some results in this mission for you to achieve your goal."

"That is fine," Ethan said. "I wasn't expecting that it would be easy."

I think you should take a look at

"Still, just moving alone won't make things that easy for you," Hannah said. "You need to make a group that will accompany you most of the time to offer support. Unfortunately, you are terrible at making allies."

"Yes, I am," Ethan said.

The idea of relying on others once he became independent sounded appealing. Still, given the current situation, he wasn't sure if he would have the time for that. Maybe he should learn summoning spells or find more allies like Luneria to support him.

He considered the possibility of summoning allies to help him during his journey. It could provide the assistance he needed in critical moments, even if only temporarily. Having a team of allies by his side would be beneficial.

Another option was seeking out individuals with powers and experiences similar to Luneria. Having companions who understood his circumstances could create a sense of unity and strength. Together, they could face their enemies with greater resilience.

However, time was running out, and the mission demanded his full attention. While he recognized the importance of having a support network, he realized that he had to focus on the present task for now. He would rely on his own abilities, the skills he had acquired, and the bond he shared with his current companions.

Eventually, the time came, and eventually, everyone readied themselves for the teleportation and summoning. Aline tried to show a reassuring smile to Mary, but she would need more than that to calm down the girl.

"I guess she was informed of the dangersâ€¦ even though it probably wasn't a good idea," Ethan thought.

Hannah concentrated her magical powers, channeling them into a focused state as she prepared for the moment Mary was summoned. She honed her skills with unwavering determination, ensuring that her magic would be swift and precise.

As Mary materialized and disappeared away from them, Hannah wasted no time. She unleashed her magic with remarkable speed, immediately casting a spell to create a connection between Mary and the rest of the group. The spell served as a guide, allowing the others to follow Mary's presence and track her movements.

The group, led by Hannah's magic, swiftly moved in unison, their steps synchronized as they pursued Mary. They navigated through the unfamiliar terrain, relying on their heightened senses and the mystical link established by Hannah's spell.
