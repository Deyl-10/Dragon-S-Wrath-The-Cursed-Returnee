Chapter 264 Helping Out

"Return home and wait for a while," Hannah said. "I am still gathering intel as we speak, it is better to calm down than make harsh decisions."

Hannah's words cut through Ethan's thoughts, reminding him that he was not alone in this battle. Hannah carried the weight of responsibility on her shoulders, and it was her duty to assess the situation and make informed decisions. So, she couldn't rush it.

Ethan returned home using Dark Stealth to avoid problems. Ethan changed into more comfortable clothes and emerged from his room, his expression serious and determined. He explained to his parents that they needed to stay at home for their safety while they waited for more information. Though his parents were worried, they trusted his judgment and agreed to follow his instructions.

"You look fine, and you solved the problem fast, so I guess we don't have to worry all that much," Michael said, and then he approached his son, but soon he stopped since he had realized about Ethan's curse. "Just make sure to rely on your friends, Ethan."

"Okay," Ethan said and then nodded.

"Make sure to call us often; we don't want to only hear reports from Hannah," Evelyn said.

"Roger that. See you all later," Ethan said and then teleported to the school before using Telepathy on Luneria. "Keep me informed about them all the time, Luneria."

"Understood," Luneria said.

Ethan made his way to the school's simulator, a place where he had spent countless hours honing his skills. With a renewed sense of urgency, he activated the training program and prepared to immerse himself in intense practice.

He started with his newly acquired Earth Armor, focusing on solidifying his connection with the element. With each movement, he could feel the power of the earth coursing through him, strengthening his defense and grounding his presence. He practiced forming shields and barriers, feeling the weight and stability of the earth supporting him.

Next, Ethan moved on to his Lightning Armor, tapping into the electrifying energy that surged within him. Sparks crackled around his body as he moved with enhanced speed and agility. He practiced channeling lightning bolts, unleashing them with precision and control.

Ethan pushed himself to the limits with each elemental armor, exploring their capabilities and finding ways to maximize their potential. He experimented with different techniques, combining his armor to create devastating attacks and impenetrable defenses.

Then, he began to train in earnest on the creation of the Fire Armor, or so he imagined that it would be called. Ethan wanted to increase his mana, but he brought a bunch of potions and drank them nonstop to speed up his training speed.

After intense focus and concentration, Ethan tapped into the power of fire, manifesting the Fire Armor. Flames enveloped his body, swirling and dancing with an intense heat. The armor seemed to be forged from molten lava, with a vibrant orange and red hue.

The flames flickered and licked at the air around Ethan, but they did not burn him. Instead, they provided him with a searing warmth and a sense of invigoration. The Fire Armor enhanced his strength and magic, infusing him with the essence of the inferno.

The armor's appearance was formidable, exuding an aura of power and dominance. Flames danced along the edges of his limbs, and his eyes glowed with an intense, fiery light. It was as if he had become one with the element of fire itself.

"Ethan, the same thing is happening everywhere in the world, and few people can close the rifts, so they are being attacked," Hannah said once she forcefully connected the call. "I will send you to some places to close the rifts, but keep your guard up."

"Roger that," Ethan said.

Despite his desire to continue honing his elemental armor skills, Ethan couldn't ignore the urgency of the situation unfolding around him. The threat of the rifts and the appearance of monsters demanded his attention and immediate action. He understood that his friends and allies needed his support, and he couldn't stand idly by while they faced danger.

With a deep breath, Ethan made a decision to put his training on hold temporarily. He knew that there would always be more to learn and improve upon, but the safety and well-being of his friends took precedence. He couldn't allow his personal goals to overshadow the larger mission at hand.

As Ethan materialized in Houston, he found himself immediately at Mary's side. The scene before him was chaotic, with a horde of ferocious wargs advancing toward them. Mary, standing tall and determined, was holding her ground with the support of a group of police officers who valiantly fought to protect her.

The wargs were formidable creatures, standing several feet tall at the shoulder with powerful, muscular bodies covered in sleek, dark fur. Their glowing yellow eyes glared with feral intelligence, and their sharp, jagged teeth were visible as they snarled and snapped at their prey.

Their numbers were staggering, forming a seemingly endless horde that advanced relentlessly toward Mary and the police officers. They moved with speed and agility, their claws digging into the ground as they closed in on their targets. The air was filled with their growls and howls, creating an eerie and menacing atmosphere.

Despite Mary's incredible strength and prowess, the sheer quantity of wargs presented a formidable challenge. For every warg she managed to take down, it seemed like two more took its place. Their coordinated attacks and relentless aggression tested her abilities to their limits.

The wargs exhibited a pack mentality, working together to flank their opponents and overwhelm them with sheer force. Their movements were coordinated and strategic, making it difficult for Mary to find an opening to strike without leaving herself vulnerable to their deadly jaws and claws.

With unwavering focus, Ethan's gaze was fixed on the source of the warg horde, the rift from which they emerged. He moved with purpose, his instincts guiding him toward the heart of the enemy's entry point.
