Chapter 211 Man And Machine

Regardless, Ethan began to dash toward North with all his might. He stored the pandemonium sword since he didn't think that he would need to use it.

After crossing a couple of kilometers, Ethan was able to see some signs of civilization ahead… As Ethan traversed the barren landscape, he came across a massive contemporary city that stretched out before him. The cityscape was a testament to human ingenuity and architectural marvel. Towering skyscrapers, sleek and gleaming, pierced the gray sky, reflecting the sunlight with their glass exteriors.

The city stood as a symbol of modernity and progress, its buildings rising proudly towards the heavens. The streets were meticulously clean and organized, devoid of any signs of neglect or decay. The gray sky, although lacking vibrancy, lent an air of sophistication to the surroundings.

The buildings stood tall and strong, their sleek designs and polished surfaces giving an impression of a city meticulously maintained. Every structure seemed to be part of a meticulously planned urban landscape, with straight avenues and perfectly aligned structures creating a sense of order and harmony.

"I guess Ivan thought that seeing this would make things easier to believe," Ethan said while looking around and realizing that he couldn't circle around it. "Ian could avoid the people there with his intangibility, and perhaps Ivan's armor could turn him invisible or something… but I will have to cross this area on foot."

As Ethan ventured further, his gaze scanned the horizon, expecting to encounter towering walls that would enclose the metropolis. To his surprise, there were no imposing fortifications or barriers, only expansive roads and distant buildings that stretched out as far as the eye could see. The landscape remained stark and lifeless, devoid of any signs of human activity or bustling crowds.

However, as Ethan continued his exploration, he couldn't help but notice a subtle shift in the atmosphere. The air grew charged with an unfamiliar energy as if something was about to unfold. A sense of anticipation mingled with the stillness, urging him to remain vigilant.

Suddenly, a series of sleek and advanced machines emerged from the seemingly lifeless buildings. They took to the air with precision and grace, soaring toward Ethan with incredible speed. The machines were unlike anything he had encountered before, their sleek frames and aerodynamic designs suggesting a level of technological sophistication beyond his expectations.

Ethan's surprise was evident as he watched the machines approach him. The people of this world seemed to have detected his presence. They reacted swiftly, sending their flying contraptions to intercept him. Their ability to respond to his presence with such efficiency indicated that they were accustomed to dealing with threats or disturbances.

"I guess they found my mana readings… their whole system must be under some sort of defense mechanism that tracks everything that has mana," Ethan thought.

It wouldn't surprise Ethan if that world the people had some satellites, but he was surprised that all the machines responded at the same time… as if they were being controlled by the same thing.

These hybrid contraptions appeared to be a fusion of helicopters and formidable machine guns bristling with deadly weaponry.

I think you should take a look at

The blades of the choppers sliced through the air with a thunderous roar while their menacing gun turrets locked onto Ethan as their target. The deafening sound of gunfire reverberated through the air as bullets sprayed in his direction. The machines moved with calculated precision, their attacks unrelenting.

"Well, I guess violence isn't the answer… Violence is a question, and the answer is yes," Ethan and he charged toward the machines.

As the bullets flew toward him, Ethan swiftly sidestepped, evading some of the projectiles with his agile movements. With a keen sense of anticipation, he raised his arms to block the onslaught of bullets, using his own body as a shield. The impact of the projectiles reverberated through his limbs, but he remained steadfast.

However, as the bullets struck his arms, Ethan felt an unfamiliar sensation coursing through his body. It was as if his mana, the essence of his power, was being gradually drained with each bullet that made contact. A momentary flicker of concern passed through his mind as he realized the gravity of the situation.

As the bullets continued to drain his mana, Ethan's annoyance grew with each passing moment. He couldn't help but feel a sense of indignation at the audacity of these people. They had barely seen him, yet they assumed they could exploit him as a mere energy source.

The realization that he was being treated like a disposable battery only fueled Ethan's determination to put an end to this confrontation. He couldn't allow himself to be taken advantage of or reduced to a mere resource for someone else's gain.

With renewed focus, Ethan channeled his frustration into his actions. He evaded the bullets with even greater agility, using his speed and reflexes to his advantage. His movements became more precise and calculated as he aimed to disable the flying machines and assert his own dominance.

With a powerful leap, Ethan soared through the air, ascending to a height of fifty meters above the flying machines. He swiftly closed the distance between himself and his targets, his fists poised for action. He delivered a series of thunderous punches with a resounding impact, shattering the machines and rendering them inoperable.

As the wreckage rained down, Ethan's attention shifted to the insides of the destroyed machines. To his horror, he discovered that the pilots were not separate entities but rather connected to the machines, their bodies intertwined with the mechanical contraptions. The sight of their agonized expressions and the realization of their entrapment struck a chord within him.

These individuals had been coerced into a life of servitude; their bodies melded with the very machines they controlled. It was a grim reminder of the depths to which some would go in their pursuit of power and control.

"What the hell… gross," Ethan thought and then grabbed the first enemy by the neck.
