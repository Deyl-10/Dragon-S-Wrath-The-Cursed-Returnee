Chapter 290 Vortex

Hannah and Luneria began to focus on using their powers at the same time while drawing the mana from the golden crown. Before long, the air around them began to vibrate.

All of a sudden, an ominous rumble reverberated through the entire facility. The walls shuddered, and the ground beneath their feet quivered with a disconcerting intensity. Equipment rattled, and loose objects clattered, adding to the cacophony of the trembling environment.

Amidst the commotion, the space in the middle of the group, where their combined magic intertwined, began to crack. It resembled a fragile pane of glass splintering under immense pressure, spiderweb-like fractures spreading outward with each passing moment. The cracks snaked through the air, distorting the surrounding space with an eerie, ethereal glow.

When the first cracks appeared, the group began to feel some shivers. They could feel some crazy amounts of malevolent energy beyond the cracks.

As the trembling and cracking intensified, an oppressive wave of chilling coldness swept through the facility. The air grew frigid, and a bone-chilling aura settled upon the group, causing beads of icy sweat to form on their brows and foreheads. The sudden drop in temperature seemed to sap their energy, threatening to weaken their resolve.

However, amidst the icy grip, three figures—Ethan, Dante, and Ian—stepped forward, their determination unwavering. They instinctively recognized the peril their companions faced and immediately moved to shield them from the biting cold.

"... Aren't you going to say something sarcastic?" Ian asked while clenching his teeth.

"Not at all; I can't shame a guy for acting like a real man," Ethan replied.

"All that changed just because you were holding the hands of a girl a few minutes ago," Ian said while rolling his eyes.

"Not for any girl, mind you," Ethan said.

Emily tried to keep her poker face, but she had a hard time focusing on the task ahead after hearing that. She didn't dislike Ethan's sincerity, but his actions were a bit bothersome in a way that was hard to deal with… since she didn't feel like he had gotten worse. Regardless, soon, the group focused on the task ahead.

As the group focused on their task, their eyes widened in alarm as the space-time rift expanded before them. It stretched wider and wider, revealing a menacing sight—a swirling vortex of dark, purple hues. It appeared like a colossal black hole, its gravitational pull threatening to devour anything that ventured too close.

The dark and foreboding nature of the vortex sent shivers down their spines, evoking a sense of primal fear. Yet, amidst the trepidation and uncertainty, Ethan stood resolute, his gaze fixed upon the churning abyss.

Without a moment's hesitation, Ethan propelled himself forward, leaping towards the menacing vortex. His unwavering determination and fearless spirit were evident as he defied the overwhelming danger before him. It was a testament to his unwavering commitment to the mission and the protection of his companions.

As Ethan's courageous leap into the swirling vortex set an example of unwavering resolve, a resounding sense of determination rippled through the remaining group members. Their eyes met, each reflecting the unwavering commitment to their mission and the shared understanding that they must follow suit.

With solemn nods and a collective breath held, they made their decision one by one. Overcoming their doubts and fears, they steeled themselves for what lay ahead. Like a synchronized dance of bravery, they leaped into the expanding space-time rift.

"This is…" Ethan muttered.

Ethan plunged into the dark vortex, his senses enveloped by an abyssal void. As he moved forward, his vision was consumed by darkness, rendering him unable to discern anything in his surroundings. He was suspended in a disorienting expanse of obscurity, his only guide being an unyielding determination that burned within him.

Every step he took was a leap of faith as he navigated through the unknown without the aid of sight. The maelstrom of darkness seemed to swallow his presence, challenging his resolve as he forged ahead.

The lack of visual cues intensified his reliance on instinct and intuition. He trusted his inner compass with each movement, allowing it to guide him through the eerie expanse. There was a profound sense of vulnerability, yet he pushed forward, propelled by his unwavering purpose and the belief that his actions could make a difference.

As Ethan pressed forward through the dark vortex, his senses heightened by the absence of sight, he began to perceive intermittent flashes of brilliant light. These vivid bursts illuminated the swirling chaos around him, resembling lightning bolts striking the vortex from the outside.

Ethan caught fleeting glimpses of diverse societies and civilizations with each radiant surge of light. He witnessed fragments of countless lives, cultures, and realms in rapid succession, like snapshots in time. The images portrayed the vast tapestry of existence, each flash revealing different eras, technologies, and societies.

In an instant, he beheld futuristic metropolises bustling with advanced technology and dazzling architecture. Skyscrapers pierced the heavens, vibrant energy pulsating through their veins. The flashes then transitioned to ancient realms, where kings and queens ruled over sprawling kingdoms, the echoes of history resonating in every stone and artifact.

"If this is the heart of the malevolent energy left behind by people when they died, I guess it makes sense that their memories would be mixed in here as well," Ethan thought.

As Ethan traversed deeper into the swirling vortex, an unexpected sensation washed over him—a searing pain akin to numerous needles piercing his body. Each puncture felt like a draining of his energy as if something was siphoning away his vital essence.

The needles of discomfort seemed to penetrate his very being, intensifying with each passing moment. The pain lanced through his limbs and surged through his core, threatening to sap his strength and resolve. The overwhelming sensation left him gasping for breath, his movements becoming increasingly labored.

"I can take this much, but I wonder if the others can... the pressure alone is mind-blowing, and I don't think that they had to deal with something like this," Ethan thought. "I just have to believe on them..."
