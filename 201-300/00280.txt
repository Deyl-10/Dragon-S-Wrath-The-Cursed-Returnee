Chapter 280 The Need

Chapter 280 The need

"... It seems that you have some powerful allies," Ethan thought while furrowing his eyebrows and looking at the demon king in the distance.

As Ethan stood before the revived doppelganger, his keen senses detected something amiss. Despite the enemy's apparent resurgence, he noticed a distinct absence of mana being utilized. This realization sent a shiver down his spine as it defied the natural order of magic and resurrection.

A wave of suspicion washed over Ethan as he contemplated the unexpected revival of the doppelganger. It seemed that this enemy had been brought back to life in a manner that defied conventional understanding. The absence of mana usage suggested that there was more at play, some unknown force or method that allowed for this resurrection.

Ethan's mind raced with questions and possible

"Hannah, I have some bad news," Ethan said via Telepathy.

"I already know; we are receiving reports that enemies are being killed and then returning stronger than before," Hannah said. "Not all of them are, but the most troublesome are."

"Prepare to retreat, everyoneâ€¦ it is time to bail out," Ethan said while using Telepathy.

Despite his frustration and burning desire to confront the enemies head-on, Ethan knew that rushing into battle without a proper plan would be reckless. The situation called for strategic thinking and careful consideration of their next move. As much as he despised the idea of retreating or running away, he understood the importance of regrouping and formulating a solid strategy.

Suppressing his inner impulse to engage in a futile battle, Ethan gathered his thoughts. He called upon the wisdom of his allies. He recognized the need to assess the situation, gather intelligence, and devise a strategy that would give them the best chance of success.

"Are you going to retreat?" The demon king asked. "I am going to enjoy watching this."

"Did you enjoy becoming someone else's dog too?" Ethan asked. "Calling you demon king would be foolish now. Demon lapdog would be more accurate. Well then, what should I call the demons that follow the demon lapdog?"

As Ethan's defiant words hung in the air, a palpable shift in the atmosphere could be felt. The rage of the demons intensified, their fury seemingly reaching new heights. The air crackled with dark energy, and the ground trembled beneath their feet.

Despite Ethan's provocation, the demons remained motionless, their menacing gazes fixed upon him. The air grew heavy with anticipation as if a storm was about to break loose. Their silence was deafening, their stillness unnerving.

"It is enough," The demon king said. "You hurt our pride, and now, I will hurt your pride."

As the demon king raised his hands, an ominous hush fell over the battlefield. A colossal red magic circle materialized in the darkened sky, its intricate symbols glowing with an otherworldly aura. Ethan's eyes widened in alarm as he realized the gravity of the situation. He knew that he had to stop the demon king before the destructive power within that circle was unleashed.

But before he could react, the demon king activated the attack. A searing beam of crimson energy erupted from the magic circle, tearing through the air with terrifying speed and intensity. The beam stretched across the horizon, its destructive force leaving a trail of devastation in its wake.

Ethan knew that the demon king wouldn't miss or mess up at such a time, so he had a bad feeling about it. The enemy's smile only confirmed that.

"Hannah, teleport everyone in our house to your base now!" Ethan shouted, using his communicator.

"I am fine with that; I am fine with destroying your hometown first," The demon king said. "Those who are dear to you can come after."

Ethan's jaw tightened as a surge of anger coursed through him. He couldn't stand idly by while the enemy wreaked havoc upon his beloved hometown. The thought of allowing the demon king to manipulate the situation and dictate the course of the battle grated against his very being.

Yet, Ethan also understood the need to maintain composure and strategize. Acting rashly without a plan would only play into the hands of their enemies. He knew that his emotions had to be channeled into focused determination, guiding his actions with a clear mind and calculated intent.

With a firm resolve and a determination burning in his eyes, Ethan made up his mind. He knew that time was of the essence and that he couldn't afford to waste a single moment. Without hesitation, he transformed into his bat form, his wings stretching wide as he soared into the air.

Calling upon the power of Lightning Armor, crackling bolts of electricity enveloped his body, granting him enhanced speed and agility. With each beat of his wings, he propelled himself forward, cutting through the air like a lightning bolt.

His senses honed, and Ethan focused all his energy on tracking down the enemy's spell. He could feel the pulsating surge of red energy in the distance, like a beacon drawing him closer. His determination burned brighter with each passing moment, fueling his flight and pushing him to go faster.

"What am I doing?" Ethan asked while biting his lips.

As Ethan's friends watched him soar through the sky, chasing after the enemy's spell, a mixture of concern and admiration filled their hearts. They understood the gravity of the situation and knew that Ethan's decision to intercept the attack came at a great cost.

Silently, they watched Ethan's figure diminish in the distance, his form blending into the vastness of the sky. Each step he took towards the spell carried him further away from them, deepening the sense of separation and the weight of their concern.

Ethan didn't have much time since his Mana was ending, but soon he reached the beam of energy and himself in front of it. With his hands open, he began to absorb the mana, but as soon as he touched it, the energy expanded and exploded destroying everything around.
