Chapter 242 The Theory Behind It

This is how the dungeon can have multiple versions of the same monster, making it more difficult for intruders to navigate and survive. Without wasting time, those two began to move toward the North. They will have to cross five hundred kilometers, but that should be easy to do even for Mary since she could fly even while yawning.

Ethan led her toward the place while just rubbing since she couldn't follow him with Lightning Armor. Several hours passed, and eventually, night came; still, they pressed on since time was of the essence.

As Ethan and Mary continued their journey into the snowy mountains, they felt the temperature dropping rapidly. The air turned icy, and they found themselves surrounded by a thick layer of snow. It was bone-chillingly cold, causing them to shiver uncontrollably.

Luckily, Ethan had come prepared and had brought extra cloaks for both of them. He quickly handed one to Mary, ensuring she was well bundled up and shielded from the freezing cold. The cloaks provided warmth and protection, shielding them from the harsh elements.

Despite the comfort of the cloaks, the darkness of the night in this unfamiliar world weighed heavily on their minds. The absence of familiar landmarks and the eerie silence added to their uneasiness. The only light came from the pale glow of the moon reflecting off the snow and the distant twinkle of stars.

"We should be almost there. Once we arrive, you can rest on the while I deal with the ice wolves," Ethan declared.

Now and then, Ethan also would talk with Hannah to give her the developments of the mission. Still was a bit problematic since they could only talk for three seconds at a time. Still, at least it seemed that Hannah was satisfied in knowing what was happening instead of being completely in the dark.

Their eyes caught sight of the entrance to the dungeon they sought. However, their path was guarded by a pack of fierce creatures known as ice wolves. These formidable beasts were majestic in their appearance, with shimmering white fur that blended seamlessly with the snowy landscape.

The ice wolves stood tall and proud, their icy blue eyes glinting with an innate sense of danger. Their muscular bodies were covered in thick fur, protecting them from the biting cold. Each wolf possessed sharp fangs and claws, ready to defend their territory from intruders.

Ethan and Mary found themselves a mere one hundred kilometers away from the border of the next country, adding an additional layer of urgency to their situation.

As the ice wolves stood guard, their piercing gaze fixed on Ethan and Mary, Ethan's eyes narrowed with determination. Sensing the urgency of the situation, he made a swift decision. In an instant, his body crackled with electric energy, and a brilliant suit of Lightning Armor materialized around him.

With lightning speed and agility, Ethan moved with an almost supernatural grace, zigzagging through the snow like a streak of lightning. His movements were precise and calculated, his strikes deadly and efficient. In a matter of seconds, the ferocious ice wolves fell one by one, unable to match his lightning-infused prowess.

As each wolf succumbed to Ethan's lightning-infused attacks, he swiftly collected their remains, carefully stowing them away in his inventory. He understood the value of these resources and knew that they could be used in various ways to aid him on his journey.

As Ethan ventured further into the dungeon, the icy chill of the surroundings intensified. The walls were coated in frost, and the air felt sharp and biting. Determined to mitigate the frigid conditions, Ethan reached into his inventory. He retrieved a set of items he had prepared for this very purpose.

First, he pulled out a magical heating stone, its warm glow casting a comforting light around him. Placing it in the center of the room, he felt the temperature gradually rise, bringing a much-needed respite from the freezing cold. The icy walls began to glisten with melting frost, revealing the stonework beneath.

Not content with merely improving his own comfort, Ethan took out a small portable campfire and set it ablaze. The crackling flames danced and flickered, providing both light and warmth. He positioned it strategically, ensuring it radiated heat throughout the area, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere within the otherwise desolate dungeon.

Finally, Ethan reached into his inventory once more and retrieved his own bed. Placing it on the now-tempered floor, he created a comfortable resting place.

"You can sit there, just don't make a mess out of it," Ethan said and then began to skin the wolves and cut the parties that could be eaten.

In the chilly interior of the dungeon, Ethan got to work cooking the legs and chest of the ice wolves. He cleaned the meat, seasoned it with herbs and spices, and grilled the legs over a fire. The sizzling aroma of the cooking meat filled the air, making his stomach growl in anticipation.

Meanwhile, he diced the chest meat and prepared a stew. He gathered vegetables, like onions and carrots, and combined them with the meat in a large pot. Adding broth and letting it simmer, the savory aroma of the stew spread throughout the dungeon.

As the meat was cooked, Ethan also sliced potatoes and seasoned them before roasting them to crispy perfection. The golden-brown potato wedges complemented the grilled meat and added a satisfying crunch to the meal.

With everything ready, he arranged the grilled wolf legs, the hearty stew, and the roasted potatoes on a makeshift platter. The sight of the mouth-watering dishes made his efforts worthwhile.

"Not bad if I do say so myself," Ethan said while taking a bite of the barbecue that he made using the meat. "Maybe it would taste even better with a bit of pepper."

Before long, Mary began to eat as well, and just like before, she hesitated, but soon she began to chew down on the food once she realized its taste. Ethan didn't cook that much, but he knew the theory behind it.
