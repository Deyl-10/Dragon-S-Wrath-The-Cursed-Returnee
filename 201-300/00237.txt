Chapter 237 Dark Magic

Ethan realized that someone from outside this world had been manipulating the leaders, encouraging their destructive actions. The external influence had led to an escalation of power and a devastating conflict that threatened to consume the entire realm.

The gravity of the situation weighed heavily on Ethan's mind. They had a responsibility to unravel the truth, confront the puppeteer behind the scenes, and put an end to the suffering of this world.

With a sense of urgency, Ethan shared his discoveries with his companions, ensuring they grasped the full extent of the danger they faced. Together, they resolved to forge ahead, driven by a shared determination to save not only themselves but also the innocent inhabitants of this shattered world.

"They didn't agree to meet up with the cloaked figure, right?" Dante asked.

"No," Ethan replied.

"... In that case, I can't say for certain if the enemies still will be here," Dante rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "If the other nations had years to advance their technology and magic, they had no reason to stay and watch."

"We still can ask Hannah to check the mana of the location they met the cloaked figure. I believe that they just appeared and vanished there before the guards arrived and after they left," Ethan said. "I will pass her a message to ready herself."

As Ethan's companions marveled at his ability to communicate with Hannah despite the distance, they couldn't help but question how it was possible. Ethan, with a knowing smile, explained to them the secret behind his telepathic communication.

He revealed that he obtained the rare gift of telepathy, allowing him to connect his mind with others across great distances. He could establish a brief connection with Hannah through this psychic link, even when they were far apart. However, due to the strain, it put on his mana reserves, the telepathic communication could only last for a fleeting three seconds.

Ethan elaborated on the limitations of his power, acknowledging that his mana pool played a crucial role in maintaining the telepathic link. With each communication, a small portion of his mana would be consumed, limiting the duration of their connection.

"... My watch can analyze, record and send the data of the mana in an environment," Ian suddenly declared. "That should help us save time and your sister's mana."

"That is convenient," Ethan said. "Follow me to the place they met the cloaked figure."

"Aren't you going to say something sarcastic?" Ian asked.

"No, if you are going to act so emo about it," Ethan shrugged.

"I can send the data to your sister afterward, but it will take some time with my mana levels," Ian explained.

I think you should take a look at

"I can do something about that since I still have some of the potions I gained from you," Emily said.

"Wait, what are we going to do about this world?" Aline asked. "It feels like you guys are forgetting that we have to help Mary with saving it."

A heavy silence fell upon the group as they contemplated Aline's words. They understood the gravity of the situation and the responsibility that came with being summoned, heroes. They couldn't simply abandon the world they were in, despite the daunting challenges they faced and the pressing matters awaiting their attention back on Earth.

The weight of their mission, the looming threat of a powerful adversary, and the realization that the fate of this world rested partially in their hands created a somber atmosphere. Each member of the group was lost in their own thoughts, considering the sacrifices and difficulties that lay ahead.

"We will decide about that once Ethan and Ian return," Dante declared.

Ethan darted through the city with lightning speed, his body enveloped in the crackling energy of the Lightning Armor. Each step propelled him forward with an exhilarating burst of power, allowing him to cover great distances in mere moments. His movements were swift and fluid as if he was dancing through the streets.

As he raced through the city, Ethan observed the last capital of this world. The atmosphere was heavy with an air of despair and desolation. The once bustling streets were now barren and gloomy, devoid of the vibrant life that once filled them. The buildings stood as silent witnesses, their worn facades reflecting the hardships and struggles endured by the people.

Despite the darkness that loomed over the city, Ethan could see that the residents, the humans who had managed to retain their humanity amidst the chaos, wore expressions of resignation and melancholy. They carried themselves with a heaviness, their shoulders slumped, their gazes downcast, as if they had accepted their impending doom.

The weight of their impending fate hung in the air, casting a palpable sadness upon the city. It seemed as though hope had all but evaporated, replaced by a pervasive sense of helplessness. The inhabitants had resigned themselves to their grim destiny, believing that their world was beyond saving.

Ethan's brow furrowed with a mixture of frustration and annoyance. He had always harbored a disdain for those who easily surrendered to adversity, those who lacked the resilience to face challenges head-on. The sight of people giving up without a fight irked him to no end.

In his mind, true strength came from perseverance and determination, from refusing to succumb to the weight of despair. He believed that there was always a glimmer of hope, even in the darkest of times, and it was a disheartening blow to witness others relinquish that flicker of possibility so readily.

Ethan's own experiences had taught him the importance of resilience and the power of unwavering resolve. He had faced countless trials and tribulations, yet he had never allowed himself to be consumed by defeat. He had always found a way to push forward, to seek solutions, and to inspire others to do the same.

After a couple of pauses, Ethan and Ian arrived in the forest, where the royal guards met the cloaked figure. Since it was day, Ethan had an easy time finding the exact spot.

"It smells in hereâ€¦ it smells of dark magic," Ian said.
