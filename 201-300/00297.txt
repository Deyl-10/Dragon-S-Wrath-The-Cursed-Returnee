Chapter 297 Final Battle (9)

The taste of victory and the rush of battle fueled their desire to grow stronger. They knew that there was no room for complacency and that they had to push themselves to their limits and beyond. The thirst for power burned within them, igniting a relentless drive to continue their ascent.

"In that case, it seems that you all are useless," The three cloaked figures said.

This time, after being defeated, the enemies weren't brought to life, and the remaining ones couldn't help but hesitate… without that assurance, they didn't feel like risking their lives once again.

"I see, in that case…" The three cloaked figures said and then pointed their hands toward the massive corpses that were floating around.

The colossal corpses of the defeated giant monsters began to tremble, their massive frames quivering as if infused with a volatile energy. Dark tendrils of chaotic energy snaked through the air, swirling and coalescing around the lifeless forms.

The chaotic energy pulsated with a malevolent force, surging into the interior of the giant monster corpses. It traveled through their veins and arteries, infusing every fiber of their being with its corrupting essence. The very essence of chaos seemed to come alive within them as if seeking to reclaim its fallen champions.

Then, he clicked his tongue in frustration, a subtle expression of his dissatisfaction. Fueled by a potent mix of determination and impatience, he took to the air, soaring towards the cloaked figures that hovered ominously in the distance.

But as he closed in on his intended targets, a sudden surge of chaotic energy erupted. In a disorienting blink of an eye, the enemies he had just defeated were teleported into a defensive formation, interposing themselves between Ethan and the cloaked figures. Ethan's momentum was abruptly halted as he found himself confronted by a formidable wall of enemies.

"That reaction speed and their surprise… they are being treated like meat shields now," Ethan thought.

Ethan didn't hesitate and kept moving to attack the cloaked figures. However, even while they were showing true terror in their faces, they moved to attack him… Ethan could tell that they had no control over their bodies now.

With a surge of determination, Ethan charged at the enemies, his eyes ablaze with resolve. He summoned his sword, its gleaming blade radiating with a fierce, otherworldly energy. In a swift motion, he swung his weapon, cleaving through the air with unparalleled speed and precision.

His strikes found their mark, cutting through the enemies with a devastating force. One by one, they fell, their bodies rent in half as Ethan's blade sliced through them like a scythe through wheat. But to his surprise, some of the enemies resisted, their dark energy shielding them from his attacks.

"... I guess this won't be easy even with the Omni Armor," Ethan thought.

The bodies turned into clouds of purple gas, and they dispersed… chaos wasn't planning to lose power by giving to those who were too incompetent, after all.

Dante's swift and decisive actions caught his attention as Ethan pondered his next move, contemplating how to conserve his energy for the grueling battle ahead. With a flourish of his blade, Dante slashed through the air in a rapid succession of strikes, each swing imbued with extraordinary power and precision.

The enemies standing before Dante began to split apart, their bodies cleaved in half as if by an invisible force. With each slash, Dante effortlessly dispatched multiple adversaries from a distance, the sheer speed and accuracy of his attacks leaving no room for the enemies to counter or defend themselves.

Emily, Aline, Mary, and Anna joined the fray with their own formidable powers. In perfect synchrony, they channeled their magic, summoning a deluge of ice spears that cascaded from above, raining down upon the enemies with unyielding force.

The air crackled with anticipation as the icy barrage descended, each spear a glimmering shard of frost guided by the skilled hands of the mage quartet. The enemies found themselves trapped in a tempest of piercing ice, unable to evade the onslaught that surrounded them.

The ice spears pierced through the air, their trajectory unerring, seeking out the enemies with precision and merciless intent. With each impact, the frozen projectiles unleashed a chilling explosion, encasing the targets in layers of ice. The enemies struggled to break free, their movements hindered by the icy grip that held them captive.

"Ethan! Deal with him!" Emily shouted.

The sudden shout from Emily pierced the air, capturing Ethan's attention. He followed her gaze, and his eyes widened in alarm as he witnessed the Demon King himself, his imposing figure rising above the chaos, raising his hands high into the sky.

Ethan's heart quickened as he watched in disbelief. The Demon King's hands glowed with an ominous energy, casting an eerie light across the battlefield. Before his eyes, a colossal magic circle began to take shape in the heavens, its intricate patterns materializing with an alarming speed.

"Chaos doesn't want to revive them anymore, but it still is powering them up…" Ethan thought when he saw the four generals shielding the demon king from Ethan's sight.

Kana, Varian, Zalgor, and Sirus sure looked terrified now… they returned back to life thinking that the same thing would happen over and over again. That is what happens when you take things for granted… Regardless, Ethan didn't have time to waste. While he also received a ring that used potions on him constantly, the cost of Omni Armor was insane… all that power naturally came with cost.

Feeling the weight of the imminent danger and the pressing need for greater power, he made a bold choice – to channel all of his remaining skill points into enhancing his Omni Armor.

Ethan's armor pulsated with newfound intensity. The familiar sheen transformed, shimmering with an ethereal glow as his skill points surged through its core. The enhancements he had invested in his armor now bore fruit, granting him access to untapped reservoirs of power.
