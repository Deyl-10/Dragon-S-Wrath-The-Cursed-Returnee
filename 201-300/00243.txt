Chapter 243 Lich

As Ethan enjoyed his meal in the depths of the dungeon, he suddenly heard distant howls echoing through the icy corridors. His senses sharpened, and he carefully listened to identify the source of the sound. The howls grew louder and closer, indicating the presence of more creatures within the dungeon.

"It seems that they don't like visits, time to work again," Ethan said when he got up.

As Ethan pressed forward, determined to confront the source of the howls, the ice wolves within the dungeon sprung into action. With menacing growls, they unleashed a barrage of ice spears, hurling them toward Ethan with intent to harm. Reacting swiftly, Ethan raised his arms, using them as impromptu shields to block the incoming projectiles.

The ice spears struck his forearms, causing a stinging sensation, but Ethan paid little heed to the pain. His focus remained fixed on his objective. Ignoring the icy discomfort, he continued his relentless advance, undeterred by the wolves' assault.

As Ethan closed in on the ice wolves, they lunged at him, jaws snapping and fangs bared. With lightning-fast reflexes, he sidestepped their attacks, evading their vicious bites. Seizing the opportunity, he swiftly retaliated, delivering powerful strikes to their heads with precision.

Using his enhanced strength, Ethan grabbed the wolves by their necks, firmly restraining them. Despite their struggles and attempts to break free, his grip remained resolute. He exerted control over the situation, exerting his dominance over the formidable creatures.

Once Ethan drained their skills and memories, the wolves fell to the ground and moved around like they had become newborn puppies. Killing them now seemed like cruelty, but Ethan didn't hesitate. After all, he had to confirm if Mary's ability would work once they lost their powers.

Ethan skinned one of them and then cooked the creature. Soon, he passed the bowl to Mary, and she began to eat it… she frowned while looking at the meal.

"... Nothing happened this time," Mary said.

Ethan continued his battles within the dungeon; he soon realized that his curse posed a significant challenge to Mary's ability to absorb powers and memories. With each enemy he defeated and absorbed, their essence became intertwined with his own, creating a complex amalgamation that hindered Mary's power.

The intensity of Ethan's curse surpassed his initial expectations, making it difficult for Mary to tap into the abilities and knowledge of the enemies he conquered. It was as if his curse formed a barrier, preventing her from fully accessing her powers.

"I suppose she will benefit more from this than me," Ethan thought. "In any case, we should wait until the others come, and then maybe I will get rid of the core. She should be able to gain some powers from it as well. If that weren't possible, I can absorb it."

For Ethan, the role of supporting and empowering others was not something that came naturally. He had grown accustomed to relying on his own strength and abilities, embracing a more independent approach to his own growth. Therefore, taking on the role of a support system for Mary was initially a bit bothersome for him.

However, as he considered the bigger picture, Ethan recognized the efficiency and effectiveness of this approach. While he could gain significant strength for himself, perhaps even the strength of ten levels, Mary had the potential to benefit far more from the same experiences. The exponential growth she could achieve through absorbing the experiences and powers of others far outweighed any personal gains he could attain.

Understanding the value of this dynamic, Ethan set aside his personal reservations and committed himself to supporting Mary's growth.

After a couple of hours of eating, Ethan and Mary confirmed that her attacks were now comparable to the ice wolves. She basically could freeze most things with her Frozen Breath… she didn't like the idea of using it, though. Since she had to fire it through her mouth.

Ethan couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for Mary's unique powers. He recognized that her abilities held as much potential as his own, if not more. The difference lay in the conditions under which their powers manifested, and it was here that Ethan found some frustration.

On the one hand, Ethan's own powers were relatively straightforward. He possessed the power to absorb the memories and powers of his enemies. While this came with its own set of challenges and risks, he could control when and how he utilized his abilities.

On the other hand, Mary's powers were both fascinating and vexing. Her ability to devour monsters and gain their powers and knowledge was a remarkable gift. Still, the conditions under which she could activate it were more restrictive.

In any case, around midnight, Mary's eating speed began to slow down, and she looked sleepy. She was truly a kid even though she was a summoned hero with a cheat-like ability.

Ethan told her to go to sleep, but she didn't like the idea of resting while Ethan was still working. Still, she only was able to fight her sleepiness for so long.

"I guess we need a vehicle, that way, she will be able to get stronger while we move," Ethan thought. "I don't know the strength of the enemies in the four nations, but I guess she barely should be able to protect herself as she is now… she needs a few more days of grinding."

Liches were powerful undead beings that had achieved immortality through dark rituals and necromantic magic. They retained their intellect and magical prowess, often ruling over hordes of undead minions. Liches were typically skilled in spellcasting and possessed a vast array of magical abilities. They were formidable opponents, capable of unleashing devastating spells and curses upon their enemies. Their immortality made them difficult to defeat, as they could reanimate after being destroyed unless their phylactery, a vessel containing their soul, was destroyed as well.
