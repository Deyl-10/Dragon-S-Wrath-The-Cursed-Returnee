Chapter 204 Getting Serious

Ian avoided the attack by becoming intangible, and then Ethan looked around with clear eyes… he used Berserker to scare Ian a little and to gain time to heal. Still, as expected, it wouldn't be easy to hit a slimy assassin.

"A guy who becomes invisible, huh," Ethan said while looking around. "And who had a crush on his teacher… what a suspicious combination."

Naturally, the plan to lure out Ian didn't work. He knew better than let such nonsense bother him. Regardless, Ian was already a bit flustered since he had never faced a warrior that could react fast enough to grab him, and he could use mana to ignore the damage if critical hits.

Ian watched with a mix of curiosity and wariness as Ethan retrieved his sword, which had pierced a tree during their intense exchange. But instead of immediately resuming the battle, Ethan surprised him by closing his eyes and entering a state of meditation.

For a moment, Ian couldn't fathom why Ethan would choose to meditate at such a crucial moment in their fight. Was he trying to catch his breath or regain his strength? The seconds ticked by, and Ian's confusion only deepened. He had expected Ethan to press his advantage while he had the upper hand, not pause for reflection.

As Ethan sat cross-legged, his face serene despite the recent battle, Ian began to wonder if there was more to this than met the eye. Could this be a tactic? A ploy to lull him into a false sense of security? Or was Ethan seeking a moment of clarity amidst the chaos?

Ian's mind raced with questions, and he cautiously kept his guard up, unwilling to let his guard down completely. He knew better than to underestimate Ethan, especially after witnessing the power of his Berserker state.

Ian couldn't stay intangible forever, so he decided to make his move faster than Ethan could make his. He didn't like the idea of using something that wasn't within his range of abilities, but he could worry about his pride later.

All of a sudden, Ethan began to levitate, thanks to the fact that Ian was using his Telekinesis ring. Thanks to that, Ethan could no longer walk or run. Still, Ethan made two mistakes… he used that item when he showed up in the middle of a field instead of using it behind a tree, and the second mistake had been the fact that he didn't try to stop Ethan's arms from moving.

With his eyes closed, Ethan moved his hands and then touched his stomach, and then he began to fall. Ian was surprised to see that Ethan realized that he tried to control him through his center of gravity. Still, soon he used the ring to control his legs and make him levitate anyway. Still, Ethan noticed that, too, and canceled the spell by touching that part with his hands.

"He can sense the effects of Telekinesis on his body, and he can even cancel it with his powers… I thought that he could only absorb magic like elemental," Ian thought while clicking his tongue. "Attacks like that won't work… I have to deal with him at close range."

"I am waiting," Ethan said. "I don't want to break my promise as well, so come at me."

Ian took a deep breath, his focus sharpening as he lowered his posture. In an instant, he burst forward with astonishing speed, his movements becoming a blur as he closed the distance between himself and Ethan. The swiftness of his charge was akin to the howling wind, leaving even the observant Ethan momentarily taken aback.

With his blade poised, Ian executed a precise and lightning-quick slash, aiming for Ethan's flank. The edge of his weapon grazed the side of Ethan's torso, drawing a shallow cut that oozed a thin trail of blood. It was a calculated strike intended to disrupt Ethan's concentration and gain the upper hand in the battle.

Ian's attack had been swift and precise, a testament to his honed combat skills. However, he knew it was just a taste of what he was capable of. He could sense Ethan's resilience and determination, realizing that he would need to unleash even more power if he wanted to overcome his formidable opponent.

The clash of steel against flesh echoed through the air, the tension between the two combatants palpable. Ethan, though wounded, maintained his composure, his eyes filled with unwavering resolve. It was clear to Ian that this battle would push both of them to their limits, and he braced himself for what lay ahead.

"You should sharpen your weapons more," Ethan said while checking the small wound.

Despite the words, Ian was satisfied. That confirmed that he could be faster than even the layer of mana that was protecting Ethan. Or he wasn't fast enough to deploy it or keep it active for long, or maybe he was low on mana. Either way, it didn't matter.

When Ian prepared to attack again, Ethan lowered his stance and then showed a serious expression after he passed his sword to his left hand.

As the blood trickled down his side, Ethan swiftly adjusted his stance, raising his left arm with the sword held firmly in front of his neck and heart. It was a defensive position meant to prioritize protection over offense. He understood that this stance limited his ability to swing his weapon freely and prevented him from launching immediate counterattacks. However, it was a calculated move to mitigate critical damage, especially in the face of Ian's incredible speed.

Ethan knew that by assuming this defensive posture, he would force Ian to continue his assault for a longer duration, exhausting his opponent and creating potential openings for a counteroffensive. While it wasn't a foolproof defense against every possible attack, it provided a vital layer of protection against swift and unexpected strikes.

Ethan braced himself with his left arm acting as a shield, anticipating Ian's relentless onslaught. He could feel the strain in his muscles, the burning sensation of his wounds, but he remained resolute. His focus honed, and he kept his eyes locked on Ian, ready to react to any sudden movements or feints.
