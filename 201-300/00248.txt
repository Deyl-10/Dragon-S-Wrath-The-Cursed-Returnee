Chapter 248 Wait

It was known among them that the sword held immense power, capable of unleashing devastating forces in the hands of a skilled wielder. Dante, with his expertise in combat, seemed like a logical choice to harness the sword's true potential.

However, Ethan held reservations about entrusting the Pandemonium Sword to Dante. While he acknowledged Dante's prowess and skill, he also recognized the value of his own experiences and the need to continue growing. Ethan was unwilling to relinquish the sword, fearing that Dante's proficiency might allow him to absorb all the experience and potential for growth that the sword held.

"If I use my powers against so many enemies like vampires, that will happen again… but I can't bother to worry about that, I just have to deal with it," Ethan thought.

As the group carried on with their mission, a noticeable shift in Ethan's demeanor became evident. Previously talkative and engaged, he seemed to withdraw into himself, becoming noticeably quieter. His once expressive eyes took on a distant gaze, as if his thoughts were consumed by something internal and deeply personal.

His friends, keen observers of his behavior, couldn't help but notice the change. Concerned glances were exchanged, and whispers of speculation filled the air. Was it the weight of their current undertaking? Or perhaps a personal matter plaguing his thoughts?

As the group emerged from the icy depths of the dungeon, they were met with an unforgiving snowstorm. Thick, swirling snowflakes obscured their vision, and the biting wind whipped at their faces, creating an icy sting upon contact.

The snowstorm raged on, obscuring their surroundings and making it difficult to discern the way forward. With each step, they fought against the biting cold and the relentless forces of nature, a testament to their resilience and unwavering spirit.

As the group pressed forward through the treacherous snowstorm, they caught sight of a sprawling base ahead. Even in the dim light of the day, the flickering torches and eerie glow from within the structures indicated signs of activity.

Among the vampires, some had set up large tents that seemed to defy conventional logic. These tents were not merely temporary shelters but were transformed carriages, pulled by headless horses. The surreal sight sent a chill down the spines of the group, a reminder of the dark forces they were about to confront.

The guards stationed around the base were vigilant, their keen senses attuned to any potential intruders. Clad in dark, flowing garments, they moved with an unsettling grace, their eyes gleaming with a hunger that surpassed mortal desires.

Despite the daylight hours, some vampires were still active, their immortality allowing them to defy the natural cycle of day and night. It was a chilling sight to witness creatures of the night roaming freely during the sunlit hours, a stark reminder of the power they possessed.

"I was expecting to see a lot of things but not this…" Emily said while furrowing her eyebrows.

"They don't use weapons or similar things since they are naturally stronger than humans," Dante said. "Still, sometimes, they summon blades and claws using blood. Only when they feel like fighting for real for a change."

As Ethan's gaze shifted away from the vampire camp, his eyes caught sight of the human encampment situated five kilometers in the opposite direction. It stood as a stark contrast to the eerie darkness of the vampire stronghold. The human camp was bustling with activity, brimming with life and preparations for the upcoming battle.

Horses adorned with armor trotted gracefully, their riders clad in sturdy armor and brandishing weapons. The rhythmic clattering of hooves echoed through the air as the cavalry trained for the impending clash. A sense of determination and readiness permeated the atmosphere, as soldiers diligently honed their skills and readied their weapons for the battle that lay ahead.

Among the human forces, catapults stood tall and imposing, their massive frames hinting at the destructive power they possessed. Skilled engineers worked tirelessly, ensuring that these formidable war machines were in optimal condition, ready to rain down projectiles upon the enemy.

Chariots, drawn by swift and sturdy steeds, were being meticulously prepared. Their drivers, skilled in the art of maneuvering through the chaos of the battlefield, honed their techniques, ensuring their chariots would be swift and lethal when the time came.

"The vampires don't fight as a group either, they will only send a small portion of their numbers," Dante added. "So, if we can decimate the first group, the others won't have any idea as to what happened. That is our best bet in this situation, a war of attrition would be too much of a problem."

"At best, they will send ten thousand of them… I am not sure that it will make much of a difference, even if we pull it off without any mistakes or making much noise," Emily said.

"I will get rid of those that try to escape and those that might notice anything in their camp," Ian declared.

Despite Ethan's initial skepticism, he couldn't deny that the new Ian proved to be a valuable addition to the group. Unlike the previous version of Ian, this new incarnation was much more agreeable and convenient to have around. He no longer exhibited the irritating mannerisms and quirks that had annoyed Ethan in the past.

However, there was an unsettling aspect to this new Ian that made Ethan feel uneasy. Whenever he acted like a typical human being, displaying emotions and engaging in ordinary conversation, it sent shivers down Ethan's spine. It was as if the authenticity of Ian's behavior contrasted sharply with his previous artificial and calculated demeanor.

In any case, The group huddled together behind the cover of the hills, their anticipation palpable in the air. The setting sun cast long shadows over the landscape, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple. Each member of the group wore a serious expression, their eyes fixed on the horizon, waiting for the moment when darkness would cloak the land.
