Chapter 240 Devourer'S Power

"Now that I think about it, the restaurants here serve monsters and animal meat," Ethan said. "Let's check those first."

With a nod of understanding, the group dispersed in different directions, each tasked with their own crucial mission. They understood the urgency and the gravity of the situation, and they moved with a sense of purpose and determination.

Ethan and Mary found themselves outside the castle, the weight of their respective roles resting on their shoulders. Despite the silence that enveloped them, the two had an unspoken understanding. They shared a common goal and a shared responsibility to protect and preserve.

As they continued their silent journey, Ethan remained comfortable in the stillness, his focus unwavering. However, he couldn't help but notice the weariness in Mary's eyes and the way her shoulders slumped under the weight of the silence and tension that enveloped them.

He could sense her exhaustion, both from the weight of their mission and the self-imposed pressure to maintain absolute silence. It was as if she believed that any noise or mistake on her part would bring dire consequences upon them.

Before long, they found an empty restaurant and then entered the place. Even the owner of the place, who was a chubby man who was drinking some beer, didn't look that eager to work. Ethan felt like asking if he wanted to be put down from his misery, but he decided to avoid that since Mary had seen too much blood already for a day. There was no need to traumatize her further.

"Give us a bowl of everything you have here, fast," Ethan said and then brought a golden amulet from his system shop.

As Ethan and Mary entered the humble restaurant, the weary eyes of the owner, a middle-aged man with graying hair, caught a glimpse of the golden amulet. In an instant, a spark of recognition and curiosity ignited within him, his eyes shining with a newfound enthusiasm.

The owner, who had seen his fair share of hardships, knew that gold held a significant value in the world. It symbolized wealth, power, and opportunity. Even in the face of imminent danger, the allure of gold still held a special place in his heart.

Setting aside his weariness and the weight of the world, the owner's focus shifted entirely to the presence of the golden amulet. His hands moved swiftly, preparing the table, readying the food, and pouring drinks with renewed energy and attention to detail.

Ethan couldn't help but notice the change in the owner's demeanor. The man's eyes, once tired and dull, now shimmered with a glint of anticipation and hope. It was as if the presence of gold had injected a renewed vigor into his veins.

As Ethan and Mary sat down at the table, they were served a variety of appetizing dishes made from simple monsters and animals found in the world they were in. The dishes looked and smelled delicious, despite their humble origins.

The first dish served was the "Minotaur Steak with Herb Butter." A thick and succulent minotaur steak, cooked to the diner's preferred level of doneness, was accompanied by a dollop of herb-infused butter melting gently over the top. The steak was juicy and tender, showcasing the natural flavors of the meat.

For a lighter option, they were served the "Basilisk Salad." Crisp greens, fresh vegetables, and sliced basilisk eggs were tossed in a zesty vinaigrette dressing. The basilisk eggs added a unique touch to the salad, providing a creamy and delicate texture.

As a seafood dish, they enjoyed the "Kraken Calamari Rings." Tender calamari rings, sourced from the fearsome Kraken, were lightly breaded and fried to a golden crisp. Served with a tangy dipping sauce, the calamari rings were a delightful combination of crunchy coating and tender seafood.

As the delectable aroma of the dishes filled the air, Mary couldn't help but feel her mouth water and her stomach growl with hunger. However, a hint of hesitation lingered in her eyes as she glanced at the enticing spread before her.

Her inner conflict was evident, torn between her longing for a satisfying meal and the lingering fear of the consequences of indulging in monster and animal cuisine. The inner battle between her desires and her apprehension played out on her face, showing both hunger and caution.

"We don't have all the time of the day," Ethan said, and he began to eat. "You look like you don't have much appetite, so eat a little of everything and then tell me the results according to your power."

Since it was made in the Capital of the country and it was food made for human consumption, it tasted great. Ethan wasn't much of an eater, but he made sure to fill his belly.

At first, Mary hesitated to eat, but once she tasted the food a bit. She began to eat insanely fast. At some point, Ethan stopped, and she kept going.

"Where the hell is the food growing with her frame like that?" Ethan furrowed his eyebrows.

As Mary savored each bite of the flavorful dishes before her, she gradually came to a realization about the unique nature of her powers. With each morsel she consumed, her ability to absorb the essence of the monsters and animals became evident.

Unlike regular consumption, where only a portion of the food is absorbed, Mary's power allows her to fully assimilate the creatures she ate. Their energy and abilities were integrated into her own, providing her with a wellspring of strength and potential.

This newfound understanding brought a sense of relief and excitement to Mary. She realized that her capacity to consume was not limited by the quantity of food but rather by the limits of her own appetite. She could continue to eat and absorb as much as she desired, tapping into an endless reservoir of power.

As Mary indulged in the sumptuous feast before her, she couldn't help but marvel at the wonders of her newfound abilities. With each bite, the essence of the creatures she consumed infused her being, granting her not only strength and power but also knowledge and skills.
