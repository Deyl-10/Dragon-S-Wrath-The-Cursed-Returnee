Chapter 291 Final Battle (3)

With each piercing sensation, Ethan's determination was tested. The pain sought to erode his resolve, challenging his ability to push forward in the face of such torment. Yet, he clenched his teeth, refusing to succumb to the physical anguish that threatened to overwhelm him.

"This can't be good…" Ethan thought.

As Ethan ventured deeper into the swirling vortex, he found himself in a dimension that existed beyond the confines of the physical realm. In this ethereal plane, his very existence was subject to a unique and challenging set of conditions. Time became distorted and unstable in its conventional sense, presenting him with a daunting race against the forces that threatened to unravel his presence.

Within this alternate dimension, the fabric of reality strained against him, exerting a relentless pressure upon his being. The essence of his existence felt fragile as if his very presence was under constant assault. The dimension sought to unravel his form as if time itself were attempting to dissolve his existence.

As Ethan faced the relentless assault on his existence within the ethereal dimension, he summoned an inner strength and honed his senses to a razor-sharp focus. With a resolute determination, he tapped into the latent power within him, drawing upon the energy that permeated his surroundings.

Through a deep concentration, Ethan channeled the energy around him, harnessing its essence to counteract the corrosive effects of the dimension. The draining sensation that threatened to unravel him now found itself met with a potent force as he replenished his own energy reserves and fortified his being.

However, as Ethan harnessed the energy, he became acutely aware of his mind processing countless dark images. The influx of power brought with it a torrent of fleeting visions—glimpses into the depths of the darkness they sought to overcome.

"Ugh, this is…" Ethan groaned while feeling a massive headache.

At one time, Ethan saw the memories of someone being stabbed from all sides, and despair passed through his body since he felt the same agony as the person who was attacked.

At another time, Ethan saw himself in the place of someone being hanged for a crime they didn't commit. At such a moment, his mind was overwhelmed by dark thoughts and rage.

Ethan also saw himself surrounded by countless enemies. The surprise and shock he felt like all those soldiers had once been his allies that turned on him for some reason couldn't be described in words.

"Those are all memories of those who left their energy here…" Ethan muttered. "Where is everyone?"

As Ethan leaped into the swirling vortex, the nature of the ethereal dimension he entered caused the fabric of time and space to twist and distort. In this realm, beyond conventional perception, there was a possibility of getting separated from the rest of the group who followed him.

His intention to shield and draw the attention of potential threats in order to protect his companions was noble. However, the unpredictable nature of the ethereal dimension meant that his selfless act could have unintended consequences. If it occurred, the separation from his allies was an unforeseen risk that Ethan willingly undertook to ensure their safety.

The swirling vortex acted as a conduit between realities. This chaotic gateway could disperse individuals throughout the dimension's vast expanse. The divergent currents of this realm could lead to unpredictable outcomes, potentially scattering the group rather than keeping them united.

While Ethan had hoped to draw the aggro and shield his companions, there was a possibility that the plan could backfire. If he became isolated, it could leave both him and the others vulnerable to the unknown dangers that lurked within the dimension.

Before long, Ethan saw himself getting closer to some sort of land. He finally could see something aside from bad memories and flashes of light.

He found himself in a desolate and surreal landscape. Massive chunks of earth, seemingly ripped from different realms, floated suspended in the air, creating an otherworldly sight that defied logic and gravity.

Each floating chunk of earth held traces of ancient civilizations, their remnants etched into the surfaces. Time-worn structures, statues, and fragments of forgotten knowledge adorned the floating islands, a testament to the once-thriving societies that had long faded into history.

As Ethan explored these ethereal islands, he discovered signs of old civilizations that had left their mark. Architectural marvels from bygone eras stood frozen in time, their intricate designs and grandeur weathered by the passage of ages. He marveled at the craftsmanship of these ancient civilizations, a testament to their ingenuity and artistic prowess.

He found remnants of forgotten cultures within the ruins, their stories whispered by the wind that rustled through the crumbling remains. Fragmented hieroglyphics, faded murals, and broken artifacts hinted at the knowledge, rituals, and beliefs of these lost civilizations.

Ethan's footsteps echoed through the quietude, the silence broken only by the ethereal glow emanating from the floating chunks of earth. Each island he encountered presented a glimpse into a different era, a unique tapestry of human history and culture suspended in this peculiar dimension.

"I thought that we would find ourselves in the middle of a land swarmed with monsters, but…" Ethan thought. "It seems that I will have to walk for a while since this place is a lot bigger than I had imagined... the dimension of chaos, huh?"

As Ethan ventured deeper into the desolate and surreal landscape, a palpable shift in the atmosphere occurred. The once peculiar environment took on an eerie and foreboding tone. The air thickened with a sense of unease, causing the hairs on Ethan's neck to stand on end.

A subtle but perceptible change seemed to ripple through the surroundings. The gentle whispers of the wind turned into ghostly murmurs and an unshakable feeling of being watched settled upon Ethan. The weight of unseen eyes bore down upon him, an unsettling presence lurking just beyond his line of sight.

"Reveal yourselves. You aren't going to get me by surprise," Ethan raised his voice.
