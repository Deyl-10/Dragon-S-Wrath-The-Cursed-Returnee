Chapter 231 Weakening

Ethan: I want to avoid any troublesome things for now. So, I will leave them alone.

"Did something happen? You seem concerned," Luneria said.

Ethan's brow furrowed with concern as he realized that Luneria was unaware of the new dungeons that had appeared. It dawned on him that without her powers, she couldn't access information or keep up with global events as she once could. He sighed, realizing it was up to him to fill her in on the situation.

Taking a deep breath, Ethan began to explain the recent events to Luneria. He described the sudden emergence of dangerous dungeons all around the world, filled with treacherous creatures and valuable treasures. He emphasized the risks involved.

Luneria listened attentively, her eyes widening with curiosity and a hint of worry. Ethan continued to share details, explaining that these dungeons presented both challenges and opportunities. He stressed the need for caution and preparedness, as well as staying informed about any updates or news related to the dungeons.

"... I see, so things are happening like that," Luneria said after she nodded. "I suppose your planet has more guardians than it should have. Thanks to it, it is becoming the center of something too big in scale. I don't know why that is the case, but I suppose some people realized that and are planning to stop more guardians from emerging and becoming a nuisance. At the same time… they might be preparing to kill those who become guardians and are teleported to other worlds."

Ethan's face twisted in a mix of concern and realization as a thought struck him. It suddenly made sense that the appearance of these new dungeons could be part of the enemies' plan to trap and eliminate newly summoned heroes. It dawned on him that they might be setting up deadly traps, waiting to ambush the unsuspecting heroes as soon as they arrived in these dangerous worlds.

This revelation sent a surge of urgency through Ethan's veins. He understood that he couldn't take this threat lightly, not just for his own safety but for the sake of future heroes as well.

Ethan started thinking about possible strategies and countermeasures. He realized the importance of gathering intelligence and conducting thorough reconnaissance before venturing into unknown territories. Building a network of reliable allies who could provide information and support became a priority in his mind.

Ethan's thoughts raced as he considered the need to enhance his own skills through rigorous training. He knew that being prepared for any dangerous encounters was crucial. He resolved to be cautious and vigilant, fully aware of the enemy's cunning and their malicious intentions.

The next day, Ethan met up with Emily, eager to discuss the revelations he had shared with Luneria. As they began to delve into the topic, their conversation was interrupted by the unexpected arrival of Dante and Aline. The duo approached with curiosity evident in their expressions, sensing that something important was being discussed.

Ethan explained to them as well what he had learned. He noticed Dante and Aline joining them, their expressions revealing a lack of surprise. It was as if they were already aware of the dungeons and the potential traps lying in wait beyond their depths.

I think you should take a look at

Curiosity tinged Ethan's voice as he probed further, seeking to understand how Dante and Aline had obtained this information. Both of them shared a knowing look before Dante spoke up, his tone calm and collected. He explained that they had been diligently researching and gathering intel on the dungeons and summoning rituals, leaving no stone unturned in their quest for knowledge.

"While we didn't consider that the dungeons might be traps waiting to lure us to the other side, I can say that some newly summoned heroes were killed upon their arrival in some worlds," Dante said. "That mind of information still is a secret, but we are working to come up with a plan to deal with that."

As the group discussed the situation further, Ethan realized that the worlds that had lost their summoned heroes so quickly were on the verge of collapse. Without the ability to summon new heroes, these realms faced imminent destruction. It became clear that the dungeons and the traps within them were not just isolated challenges but part of a larger threat that endangered entire civilizations.

Dante, Aline, and Emily, rather than being surprised, seemed to have prior knowledge of this grim reality. They understood the dire consequences that awaited these worlds if they couldn't find a way to summon new heroes and restore the balance between light and darkness.

This revelation weighed heavily on Ethan's mind. He couldn't ignore the urgency of the situation and the impact their success or failure would have on these struggling worlds. The fate of countless lives and civilizations rested in their hands, making their mission more critical than ever.

The group contemplated the gravity of their task, realizing that time was running out. They couldn't afford to hesitate or underestimate the dangers that lay ahead. The collapse of these worlds was a pressing concern that required immediate action.

"The enemy wants to stop the increase of our numbers… that is the first step to stop our potential," Emily said while showing a serious expression. "After that, they will make sure to keep increasing their and then attack when they have the upper hand."

"They are already working on that since they are convincing some of us to join their side," Ethan said.

The group was left stunned as they realized the gravity of the situation: the summoned heroes who had joined the enemy's side were being groomed to attack Earth. It made perfect sense, given the circumstances.

The significance of this revelation hit them hard, and they couldn't help but feel a mixture of disbelief and concern. The enemies were using the powers and abilities of the very heroes summoned to protect Earth against their own home.

The pieces of the puzzle began to fall into place, and it became clear that the dungeons and traps were all part of a larger scheme to weaken Earth's defenses.
