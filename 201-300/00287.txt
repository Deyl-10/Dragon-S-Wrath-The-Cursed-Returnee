Chapter 287 Nature

Chapter 287 Nature

As Ethan distanced himself from others, his social interactions became limited, and he gradually lost touch with many of his friends. He struggled to trust new people or form new connections, afraid of once again being labeled as annoying or too exuberant.

The transformation from a vibrant, outgoing child to a more introverted and reserved individual was a gradual process influenced by the emotional impact of that hurtful conversation. Ethan's self-perception was profoundly affected, leading him to question and suppress his natural inclination to radiate positivity and engage with others.

"This is nonsense; something that happened when I was just ten couldn't have shaped me this much," Ethan thought while furrowing his eyebrows.

As Ethan reflected on his past, he couldn't help but acknowledge the changes that had occurred within him. While he had initially wanted to deny becoming more reclusive, the evidence was clear. He had gradually withdrawn from social interactions and had become more introverted over time.

However, amidst this inward shift, there was another aspect of Ethan's life that had unexpectedly blossomed — his connection with his family. Despite being at an age when rebellion and distancing oneself from parents were often considered the norm, Ethan found himself drawn closer to his family.

Perhaps it was the realization that his friends' opinions had affected him deeply, leading him to seek solace and understanding within the supportive embrace of his loved ones.

As Ethan delved into his memories, he couldn't help but recall the initial months after his summoning. At that time, he was indeed a typical young boy, brimming with the innocence and uncertainties of adolescence. The sudden shift from his familiar world to a realm filled with magic and fantastical beings had left him feeling bewildered and out of his depth.

In those early days, Ethan found himself easily swayed by the opinions and expectations of others, particularly when it came to interactions with the opposite sex. He was no stranger to the nervousness that often accompanies teenage boys in the presence of girls, finding it challenging to maintain prolonged eye contact or engage in confident conversation.

His lack of experience and self-assurance added to his feelings of vulnerability, causing him to second-guess his actions and words. Ethan's journey as a virgin boy navigating this new world was filled with awkward moments and self-doubt as he struggled to find his footing and understand the intricacies of relationships.

As Ethan reminisced about his journey, a particular incident stood out vividly in his mind. It was the moment he discovered the extent of his power when one of the princesses of Hedo attempted to surprise him with an affectionate hug from behind. To his astonishment, the encounter resulted in the princess losing the memories of five years of her life.

This unexpected revelation left Ethan both fascinated and perturbed. He realized that his power extended far beyond the realm of physical strength or magical abilities. The inadvertent alteration of memories showcased a profound aspect of his being, one that held immense potential for both positive and negative consequences.

The incident with the princess of Hedo served as a stark reminder of the responsibility that accompanied his newfound power. It made Ethan acutely aware of the impact his actions could have on others, and he became more cautious in his interactions, particularly with those whose memories could be influenced.

"Do you realize it now?" Emily asked.

"... I need to talk with Hannah. You two have been talking only about me, I can tell," Ethan said and then facepalmed. "You asked her for my three sizes as well?"

"I really hope that this isn't a question with a double meaning," Emily said.

Ethan's laughter echoed through the room, a mix of amusement and self-reflection. He recognized the truth in his own words—that his history wasn't a mere story of overcoming weaknesses and growing stronger. It was a complex and multifaceted journey, filled with both triumphs and hardships.

Taking a deep breath, Ethan resolved to embrace this realization and use it as a catalyst for personal growth. He understood that true strength lay not only in physical prowess or magical abilities but also in acknowledging and confronting one's own shortcomings, fears, and vulnerabilities.

With a newfound determination, Ethan embarked on a path of self-discovery and self-improvement. He embraced the challenges that lay ahead, recognizing that they were not just tests of physical prowess but also opportunities for emotional and mental growth. He acknowledged that true strength came from acknowledging and embracing one's weaknesses, learning from them, and using them as stepping stones toward personal growth.

Deep in his heart, this annoying voice bothered Ethan more than the forgotten voices. Don't get too close to others aside from his family… that was what Ethan was hearing.

"You are not a coward; you are stupid, but not a coward," Ethan thought. "It is time to grow a bit more, not just in size."

Ethan's eyes widened in alarm as he felt Emily's hand gripping his tightly. A surge of panic coursed through him as he sensed his own mana instinctively reaching out and draining hers. He quickly realized that his curse, the ability to absorb mana, had inadvertently activated in the presence of Emily's mana.

Fear and concern flooded Ethan's thoughts as he desperately tried to regain control over his power. He knew the consequences of draining someone's mana could be severe, and he didn't want to harm Emily in any way. With a strong resolve, he focused his mind, channeling his energy to counteract the unintentional absorption.

As he concentrated, the flow of mana from Emily began to weaken, gradually diminishing until it finally ceased. Ethan's breathing slowed, relief washing over him as he realized he had managed to regain control over his curse.

"You are a warrior by nature, and I can see now that instead of being able to drain all forms of energy from the things you touch, you just attract everything, be it allies, enemies, conflicts, peace… everything," Emily said. "You are truly like a magnet. That is why your system makes you level up, grants you skill points, and makes the skills level up over and over again. You can buy items, potions, and… can you please stop caressing my hand like that?"
