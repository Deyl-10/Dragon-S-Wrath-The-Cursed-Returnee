Chapter 226 Why

The thought struck Ethan like a bolt of lightning, igniting a spark of awe and wonder within him. He had encountered numerous potions and elixirs on his journey, each with its own unique properties and effects. Yet, the significance of this single feather surpassed anything he had encountered before. It was a rare and precious treasure, capable of bestowing a rejuvenating touch upon the world around him.

With this newfound understanding, Ethan's mind raced with possibilities. The feather could mend broken bodies, heal wounded spirits, and breathe life into withered landscapes. It held the potential to restore strength and vitality to those who had been worn down by the passage of time or the harshness of their trials.

And yet, a promise is a promise… Ethan couldn't go back on his agreement to help Ivan revive his wife. Ethan knew that a man that goes back into his world was no man at all.

The time the silver bird began to flap its wings. A radiant glow emanated from it, enveloping his surroundings. At that moment, time itself seemed to shift and warp before his eyes. The flow of time in that world accelerated to an astonishing degree, causing hours to pass in the span of mere seconds.

Ethan's senses were overwhelmed as he witnessed the rapid progression of time. The sun moved across the sky in a blur, casting long shadows that danced and shifted with unnatural speed. The breeze whipped around him, carrying the whispers of accelerated moments and fleeting fragments of conversations.

As the Time Silver Bird extended her wings, a radiant aura of mana enveloped the world. Her power surged forth, infused with the essence of growth and vitality. The once barren and desolate lands that had been ravaged by time and neglect now began to flourish under her influence.

With a gentle wave of her wings, the surrounding vegetation responded eagerly. Lush greenery sprouted and bloomed with astonishing speed, transforming the landscape into a vibrant tapestry of life. Flowers blossomed in a riot of colors, their petals unfurling as if in celebration of newfound rejuvenation.

But it wasn't just the plants that thrived under the Time Silver Bird's magical touch. From the depths of her power, ethereal beings emerged. Creatures long thought extinct or on the brink of oblivion reappeared, their forms ethereal and otherworldly. Majestic beasts, delicate insects, and elusive creatures that once roamed the land now found sanctuary in this revitalized realm.

It was as if the Time Silver Bird had preserved these endangered species within her own mystical realm, shielding them from the ravages of time and the encroachment of civilization. Through her magic, she had ensured their survival, ready to release them back into the world when the time was right.

However, Ethan noticed the absence of replicated human beings from that world. The Time Silver Bird, in her wisdom, had chosen not to interfere with the natural order of human existence. Instead, she focused on the restoration of the environment and the preservation of endangered species, allowing humanity to find its own path forward.

As the Time Silver Bird expended her mana, her majestic form gradually diminished in size. Ethan's furrowed his eyebrows, realizing that the creature was sacrificing her own essence to bring about the restoration of the world. He watched as she transformed into a diminutive figure, no more than a couple of centimeters tall, resembling a small bird with shimmering feathers.

I think you should take a look at

With wings that glimmered with residual magic, the miniature Time Silver Bird gracefully took flight, fluttering toward Ethan's shoulders. The weight of her presence felt light yet profound as she perched there, her tiny form radiating a comforting warmth.

Ethan marveled at the profound connection he felt with this extraordinary creature. He understood that the Time Silver Bird, in her diminished state, had chosen to accompany him on his journey. She had entrusted him with the continuation of her mission, the preservation of the world's delicate balance.

"My job here is done; until I find something else that I should do, I will offer you my assistance," The time silver bird said. "My name is Luneria. What is yours again?"

"Maybe I shouldn't pretend that I don't have a choice in this matter… it is Ethan," Ethan replied. "Anyway, how can I benefit from this, and how can you touch me and not lose your mana?"

"My powers are at the initial stages again, but I can still use time magic. That should answer how I can help you," Luneria replied. "As for the second question, even in my weakened state, my existence is stronger than yours, so your power won't affect me.

That should change once you become two times stronger."

Ethan let out a weary sigh, his temples throbbing with a growing headache. The magnitude of the situation weighed heavily on his mind, and the bizarre turn of events left him grappling for comprehension. The presence of the Time Silver Bird, the explosion of the reactor, the accelerated flow of time - it was all too much to process… for most people.

As he tried to make sense of the extraordinary circumstances, Ethan realized a recurring pattern. His power and his abilities could only have an impact on others if he could first overcome them. It was a revelation that dawned on him amidst the chaos and uncertainty. He would need to confront and defeat the forces that threatened its harmony to bring about change and safeguard the world and its inhabitants.

The realization brought a mix of determination and weariness. While Ethan understood the weight of his responsibility and the necessity of his actions, he couldn't help but feel the toll it took on his own well-being. The burden of being the one who must stand against the darkness, who must face unimaginable challenges, weighed heavily on his shoulders. Still, that was more of the same for him, so soon he shook those thoughts out of his mind. Same shit, different day. Or business as usual.
