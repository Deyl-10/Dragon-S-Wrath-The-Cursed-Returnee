Chapter 293 Final Battle (5)

The swords, with their gleaming blades and intricate designs, exuded an aura of power and ancient craftsmanship. Their presence carried an undeniable familiarity as if they were kindred spirits to the very weapon Ethan wielded. The resemblance was uncanny as if the ethereal realm itself had forged these weapons to mirror his own.

"Hmm, I dare say that this isn't good for me," Ethan said. "Considering this place and the atmosphere, maybe they can mimic the power as well fairly well..."

Ethan didn't know if those weapons would have the same power as the pandemonium sword. Still, it was better not to assume otherwise. Unless he wanted some unpleasant surprises soon.

As Ethan surveyed the multitude of summoned heroes, his mind raced with conflicting thoughts and concerns. While he understood the urgency of neutralizing the impending threat, he also grappled with the moral dilemma of fighting against fellow summoned heroes.

His friends, Anna and Mary, were young and innocent, unaccustomed to the harsh realities of battle. Ethan didn't want to burden them with the weight of taking lives, especially when they were just children. He wanted to protect their minds from unnecessary damage and shield them from the darkness that loomed before them.

While Ethan was thinking, the enemies that had bows summoned magic arrows and fired them at him. Ethan opened his eyes widely when they saw him crossing the distance of two hundred meters in a second and almost piercing his head.

Ethan reacted out of reflex, and he did well by grabbing the first arrow… it pushed him backward for dozens of meters; blocking the hit in any other way would have been painful.

As the tension in the ethereal realm heightened, a sudden rain of arrows cascaded from the darkened skies above, pelting the chunk of earth where Ethan stood. The arrows rained down with relentless force, their deadly tips poised to wreak havoc upon impact.

Reacting swiftly, Ethan's instincts kicked in, guiding him to leap away from the arrows as they pierced the ground. The moment they struck, shockwaves rippled through the platform, causing the earth beneath their feet to tremble and fracture.

The once-solid ground began to crumble, giving way to an impending collapse. The chunk of earth splintered and split apart, fragments falling away into the void below. The precarious platform that had supported them now became a treacherous trap, threatening to cast them into the abyss.

Ethan's agile movements propelled him away from the disintegrating platform, his muscles strained with the effort to avoid the cascading debris. With each leap and bound, he navigated the crumbling terrain, narrowly escaping the plummeting sections of the earth.

As the chaos of the crumbling platform unfolded, a new threat emerged from the ranks of the summoned heroes. With menacing determination, they brandished their melee weapons, which seemed to take on a life of their own. These weapons sliced through the air with incredible speed, hurtling toward Ethan with a malevolent intent.

The summoned heroes themselves emitted an ominous aura that enveloped their bodies, enhancing their physical attributes. Their movements became swifter and more agile, their strength seemingly amplified by the dark energy that surrounded them. It was as if the very essence of their beings had been infused with the powers of the ethereal realm.

"That must be the chaos energy…" Ethan thought.

As the enemies closed in, their intent to pierce, cut, and cleave Ethan with their deadly weapons became apparent. Spears were thrust toward him with alarming speed, swords were swung in deadly arcs, and axes were brought down with brutal force. Their every move aimed to rend him asunder.

Yet, Ethan's reflexes were honed to perfection. With an uncanny instinct, he anticipated their attacks, moving with a combination of agility and precision that seemed almost supernatural. He dodged, ducked, and weaved between the incoming strikes, narrowly avoiding the lethal blows that sought to claim him.

Spears whizzed through the air, only to find empty space where Ethan had been a mere moment before. Swords sliced through the ethereal realm, missing him by a hair's breadth as he twisted and contorted his body with uncanny grace. Axes swung in mighty arcs, but Ethan's evasive maneuvers spared him from their devastating impact.

His movements were a dance of survival, a symphony of perfectly timed steps that defied the odds. The enemies' attacks were met with swift counters and expertly executed evasions. Each dodge was calculated, each sidestep executed with flawless precision, allowing Ethan to elude the imminent danger that surrounded him.

Ethan summoned his pandemonium sword and blocked one of the attacks. Much to his surprise, Ethan was barely able to block the attack; his strength and the enemy's were on the same level.

"I didn't hear anyone from C rank or below defecting, so this means that this guy is at least a D rank?" Ethan furrowed his eyebrows.

As Ethan focused on evading the enemies' frontal assault, he became aware of a new threat emerging from the sides. They lunged forward with their weapons, seeking to catch him off guard and exploit any opening they could find. However, rather than attempting to dodge their strikes, Ethan made a calculated decision.

With unwavering determination, Ethan allowed the enemies' weapons to make contact with his body. Their swords, spears, and axes scratched against his skin, leaving behind shallow marks that served as a testament to the battle that raged around him. Each blow landed with force, but Ethan's Earthen Armor, resolve, and preparation allowed him to endure the attacks.

When the enemies flinched due to the surprise, Ethan grabbed them by their necks and confirmed that his power didn't work. The dimension of chaos was protecting them against it…

Undeterred by the setbacks, Ethan's resolve remained unshaken. With a determined focus, he channeled his inner power, invoking the forces of electricity to form the Lightning Armor around his body. Arcs of crackling energy enveloped him, generating an electrifying aura that pulsed with formidable power.
