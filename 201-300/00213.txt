Chapter 213 Fear

Ethan's gaze narrowed as he assessed the towering adversaries before him. He could feel the weight of their immense power, their purposeful construction, and their advanced technology. Yet, he remained undeterred, his determination unyielding.

"They decided to invest their time and resources in some weird thingsâ€¦" Ethan thought upon realizing that those things probably could kill him with ease.

With an eerie grace, they withdrew massive swords from their backs, their elongated blades gleaming with an otherworldly aura. These swords, reminiscent of ancient samurai weaponry, exuded a sense of power and mystique.

The robots stood tall, their menacing forms casting imposing shadows across the desolate landscape. Their eyes burned with an intense determination, reflecting an unwavering commitment to their cause. With their swords firmly gripped, they assumed a fighting stance, their bodies poised and ready to engage in a deadly dance.

"What a crazy joke," Ethan thought.

With thunderous force, the giant robots swung their massive swords toward Ethan, their sheer size and power rending the very fabric of the asphalt beneath them. The ground cracked and shattered as the blades sliced through the solid surface, leaving behind a trail of destruction in their wake.

Reacting with instinctive agility, Ethan leaped into the air, narrowly evading the devastating strikes aimed at him. The force of the robots' attacks created a shockwave that reverberated through the surroundings, propelling Ethan even higher into the sky. His body twisted and turned in mid-air as he fought to regain his balance, the wind whipping past him with an intensity that matched the fury of the battle below.

From his elevated vantage point, Ethan surveyed the unfolding chaos. The cityscape stretched out beneath him, a mosaic of crumbling buildings and desolate streets. The giant robots, their hulking frames dominating the landscape, stood as formidable adversaries, their swords hungry for destruction.

The three giant robots synchronized their movements with chilling precision as the battle reached its crescendo. Their massive swords gleamed in the dim light, anticipation radiating from their formidable frames. With a synchronized movement, they raised their weapons high into the air, preparing to strike Ethan simultaneously, aiming to rend him into countless pieces.

The ground quivered beneath their colossal presence, echoing the impending destruction about to be unleashed. The air grew heavy with anticipation as the robots locked their gazes on their agile adversary, their mechanical eyes glowing with a malevolent gleam.

Ethan, undeterred by the overwhelming odds stacked against him, braced himself for the onslaught. He could feel the weight of the moment, the convergence of steel and determination. His senses heightened, and his focus sharpened as he prepared to face the impending storm of destruction.

As the giant robots swung their massive swords with lethal intent, Ethan swiftly reacted, summoning his elemental powers. With a focused concentration, he conjured a fiery ball of flames and a swirling orb of water.

With a swift motion, Ethan combined the two elements, merging the fireball's intense heat with the water ball's soothing coolness. The collision of fire and water created a violent reaction, unleashing a torrent of steam that erupted into the air with a deafening scream.

But even as the steam engulfed the surroundings, the enemy's swords descended upon Ethan, their blades aiming to cleave him in two. The impact of the swords sent shockwaves through the air, tearing apart the ground beneath him.

Yet, in the midst of the chaos, Ethan vanished from sight. His body seemed to dissolve into the swirling steam, becoming one with the billowing mist. His mastery over the elements allowed him to transcend the physical realm, evading the deadly blow.

The enemies' swords clashed together, their blades meeting only empty space. The steam dissipated, revealing an empty spot where Ethan once stood. He had disappeared, leaving his adversaries in a state of confusion.

But amidst the confusion, a shadow silently materialized behind one of the towering machines. Ethan had invoked the power of Dark Stealth, blending seamlessly into the darkness, his form hidden from sight. With his presence concealed, he became an elusive phantom, striking from the shadows.

With calculated precision, Ethan swiftly closed the distance, moving like a specter with unparalleled speed and agility. His movements were fluid and precise, his training allowing him to exploit the smallest of openings.

In an instant, he launched himself towards the exposed nape of one of the robots. His hand, shrouded in darkness, struck with ruthless efficiency. His fingers found their mark, delving into a vulnerable spot in the machine's armor.

With relentless determination, Ethan continued his assault on the vulnerable spot he had discovered in the giant robot's armor. Strike after strike, he unleashed a flurry of blows, exploiting the weakness with calculated precision. Each hit reverberated through the metallic frame, causing the machine to stagger and groan under the pressure.

As his attacks intensified, the structural integrity of the robot's armor began to crumble, exposing the cockpit within. Ethan's blow breached the defenses with one final, decisive strike, tearing open the compartment and revealing the driver inside.

Without hesitation, Ethan seized the opportunity, launching himself into the cockpit with a swift and lethal motion. His movements were swift and decisive, the culmination of years of training and honed combat skills. In a matter of seconds, the driver's fate was sealed as Ethan's strike found its mark, ending their life.

The cockpit filled with an eerie silence as the lifeless body slumped forward, relinquishing control over the giant machine. Now in command of the robot, Ethan stood tall, his gaze sweeping over the remaining adversaries.

"Maybe I should store all of this in my inventory and sell it later; I am sure that plenty of people on Earth want to buy alien technology," Ethan thought.

As the remaining two giant robots stood there, their massive frames vibrating with uncertainty, their attention focused on the mysterious death of their fallen comrade. Ethan emerged from the shadows, revealing himself. The sight of him, standing there undeterred and ready to continue the fight, sent a chilling wave of realization through the robots.
