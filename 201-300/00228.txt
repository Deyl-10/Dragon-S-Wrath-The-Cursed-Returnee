Chapter 228 Caution

And then, in a breathtaking climax, a blinding surge of light burst forth from the epicenter of the transformation. It was a spectacle that defied description, an eruption of pure life force that illuminated the entire area with its brilliance. For a moment, everything was bathed in the overwhelming radiance, as if the world itself had come alive in celebration.

As Ivan's wife slowly rose from the surface where she had been lying, her movements were tentative at first, as if she was reacquainting herself with her own body. Her eyes once clouded with the weight of illness, now sparkled with renewed vitality and curiosity.

Her once pale complexion had regained a healthy glow, her skin radiant and vibrant. A cascade of lustrous, flowing black hair framed her face, its color restored to its natural richness. The lines of weariness and illness that had etched themselves upon her features seemed to have been gently smoothed away, replaced by a serene and youthful glow.

Her gaze wandered about the surroundings as if taking in the world with fresh eyes. The vibrant hues of nature seemed more vivid, the sounds of life more vibrant and melodic. It was as if she had been granted a second chance at experiencing the wonders of existence, and she embraced it with an open heart and a renewed sense of awe.

And yet, something was off; Anna was already crying, and Ivan looked speechless. Ian also noticed that his mother wasn't reacting like he had envisioned; it felt like she didn't recognize them.

"Mom?" Anna asked.

"You are… I know you, but…" Ivan's wife said while showing a complicated expression.

"It might take some time for her to recover her memories… the connection between body and spirit was restored, but it doesn't mean that everything will be perfect upon her awakening," Luneria said. "She needs some time to recover and get used to the world of living again."

As Ivan, Anna, and Ian looked upon Kelly, a tinge of disappointment flickered in their eyes. Though they had achieved the remarkable feat of restoring her health and vitality, it was evident that her memories had not returned. The shared moments, the cherished memories of a life lived together, had been seemingly lost… even if it could be temporary.

Yet, amidst the disappointment, there was a glimmer of solace. They had succeeded in restoring Kelly's physical well-being, granting her a second chance at life. The warmth of her smile, and the light in her eyes, though devoid of the memories they had hoped to revive, spoke of a newfound happiness and gratitude.

They knew that they had come so far, overcoming countless obstacles and challenges to bring Kelly back from the brink of despair. While the loss of her memories was a significant blow, it did not diminish the magnitude of their accomplishment.

"It seems that your other friends are arriving," Luneria said.

"... You guys should clean up things here; I will convince them to slow down a bit," Ethan said after a long sigh. "My sister, her boss, and Dante probably will want to question you further, but nothing serious will happen if you cooperate."

"... It will take some time before we can pack everything," Ivan said while showing a tired expression.

I think you should take a look at

"Then I will pack things for you since you achieved your goal," Ethan said.

With practiced efficiency, Ethan swiftly moved through Ian's camp, his hands deftly gathering and organizing the belongings into his inventory. Every item, every tool, every piece of equipment was carefully assessed and cataloged within the boundless space of his storage.

His movements were almost a blur, a testament to his years of experience in managing and organizing resources. His keen eyes scanned the surroundings, quickly identifying the valuable and essential items while putting away the unnecessary or redundant.

The barrier was undone since all the equipment vanished, and when Dante arrived and landed like a meteor, he looked around and furrowed his eyes in confusion. Ethan looked wounded, but it seemed that he stopped fighting a while ago. Ivan, Anna, and Ian raised their arms, announcing their surrender.

"What happened, Ethan?" Dante said while looking around with eyes filled with suspicion.

"You arrived too late for the party; it is time to clean up and return home," Ethan said.

Dante was confused since he could see Ivan's wife, Kelly, alive and well, but the atmosphere was weird. Regardless, Aline and Emily eventually landed, and they also looked ready to fight, despite looking exhausted.

In the end, those three decided to reveal what had happened in detail. The only thing that they hid was the fact that Ethan helped them in the end and that Ian managed to stop him while the experiment was taking place.

While Ethan didn't like that his reputation was being tarnished like that, he couldn't complain. Still, it bothered him a lot more than he had expected, hearing that the likes of Ian managed to slow him down.

The group made their way back to the starting point in silence, reflecting on their journey and the events that had unfolded. Though their goals had been accomplished, there was a somber atmosphere among them. They knew that Kelly, despite being revived, had lost her memories and was now a blank slate.

During their return to Earth, Ivan, Anna, and Ian made several attempts to engage Kelly in conversation, hoping that some fragments of her past might resurface. They asked her questions, shared stories, and showed her familiar objects. Still, Kelly remained unable to recall anything from her previous life. It was as if her memories had been completely erased.

"... I see," Hannah said while she was looking at Kelly and Ethan, eyes filled with suspicion. "We will have to investigate the matter further, and since you three used Teleportation without authorization, you will have to stay here the whole time. Ms. Kelly didn't do anything wrong, but for the time being, she should stay here as well in order to let the dust die down and to avoid rumors."
