Chapter 246 Clen Up

The intelligence of a dungeon core varied from one dungeon to another. Some cores exhibited basic intelligence, limited to instinctual behaviors and reactions. They operated on a more primal level, focused primarily on protecting the dungeon and its treasures from intruders.

However, there were also dungeon cores that displayed a higher level of intelligence akin to that of a sentient being. These cores were capable of strategic planning, creating complex traps and puzzles to challenge adventurers. They could even communicate with those who ventured into their domain, either through telepathy or by manipulating their surroundings.

In any case, the end of the dungeon was like the interior of a large dome, round and large. The walls, the ceiling, and the floor were completely overtaken by a thick layer of ice.

As Ethan ventured further into the dungeon, he reached a spacious chamber with an ethereal glow emanating from the center. His gaze was drawn to the sight of the dungeon core, a pulsating orb of magical energy floating effortlessly in mid-air. It radiated a sense of power and authority, marking it as the heart of the dungeon.

However, as soon as Ethan laid eyes on the dungeon core, he felt a surge of energy ripple through the chamber. The core began to channel its power, summoning forth a group of ice wolves that were larger and more formidable than any he had encountered before. These beasts, with their icy blue fur and glowing eyes, exuded a chilling aura.

Ethan could sense the raw power emanating from these massive creatures. They snarled and growled, their breath forming an icy mist in the air. It was clear that the dungeon core had called upon these enhanced guardians to protect itself and repel any intruders.

"How cute. You think that making them bigger will be enough," Ethan said while furrowing his eyebrows. "You must be a really dumb dungeon core that got lucky appearing in a place with good conditions for your growth."

As the giant ice wolves lunged at Ethan with ferocious determination, their jaws snapping and teeth gleaming, he moved with an uncanny grace and agility. It was as if he were dancing, his body weaving and dodging effortlessly to evade their savage bites.

Ethan's lightning-fast reflexes allowed him to anticipate their movements with astonishing precision. He sidestepped the lunges, ducked under the snapping jaws, and leaped over the sweeping attacks. His movements were fluid and graceful, a mesmerizing display of skill and finesse.

Ethan let the core summons a bunch more of giant ice wolves, up to the point that it filled the entire room before he began to fight back. The big ones would make Mary even stronger, so he couldn't afford to increase the stock even further… in any case, Ethan used light in armor once that happened. He began to move around like a horizontal lightning bolt.

With each evasion, Ethan found openings to strike back. His weapon became an extension of his body, delivering swift and precise counterattacks. He aimed for vulnerable spots on the ice wolves' bodies, targeting their necks, legs, and vital organs. His strikes were calculated and efficient, inflicting significant damage with each well-placed blow.

In a matter of seconds, Ethan killed all the giant ice wolves. It reached a point that he was wondering what he was doing there… It wasn't a challenge. His level was relatively low, but thanks to Lightning Armor, Ethan felt like he was at least two times stronger.

After Ethan stored away the corpses. He felt the atmosphere changing… As Ethan's eyes scanned the chamber, he noticed a sudden surge of icy energy gathering at the center. The air grew colder, and the very walls of the dungeon seemed to come alive with a glimmering frost. Within moments, a colossal ice wolf, towering at an incredible twenty meters in length, materialized before him.

The new adversary was an awe-inspiring sight to behold. Its icy fur glistened with an ethereal blue hue, and its eyes burned with a chilling intensity. Each step it took sent tremors through the ground, and its breath billowed out in icy clouds. The sheer size and power of the colossal ice wolf sent a shiver down Ethan's spine.

With a low growl that reverberated through the chamber, the colossal ice wolf locked its piercing gaze upon Ethan. Its fangs, sharp and menacing, glinted in the dim light, hinting at the devastating bite it could deliver. The icy tendrils that formed its body seemed to shift and ripple, ready to strike at a moment's notice.

As Ethan stood his ground, facing the imposing figure of the bear, he felt an intense chill permeating the air. A bone-chilling wind swept through the chamber, carrying with it a freezing mist that seemed to cling to every surface. The bear's massive form exuded an aura of frigid power.

In an instant, the bear drew in a deep breath, its chest expanding with an otherworldly strength. The very temperature in the room seemed to plummet as the bear unleashed its frozen breath. A blast of icy mist erupted from its jaws, spreading out in a powerful gust that froze the surrounding air.

Ethan's senses were overwhelmed by the freezing onslaught. The icy mist wrapped around him, causing his skin to prickle with a numbing cold. He could feel the chilling sensation seeping into his bones, turning his breath to frost and causing his extremities to tingle.

As the battle reached its climax, Ethan's annoyance grew with each passing moment. Fueled by frustration and a desire for a swift end, he tapped into his vast pool of mana. With a resolute focus, he channeled his energy into summoning the massive blade from his past encounter with the giant robots.

With a surge of power, the colossal blade materialized in the air above Ethan, suspended by his command. The sheer weight and size of the blade were enough to cause the very ground to tremble beneath it. The blade gleamed with a cold, metallic shine, its edges sharp and deadly.
