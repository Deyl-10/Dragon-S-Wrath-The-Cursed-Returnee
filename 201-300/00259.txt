Chapter 259 Earthen Armor

"Thank you for your hard work," Hannah said. "You should go home and rest now."

"Did something happen?" Dante asked.

"I wanted to give you all the chance to rest instead of worrying, but I guess teenagers aren't known exactly for listening to their elders," Hannah said and then shrugged. "In the last seventy-two hours, ten dungeons appeared across the globe. The enemies are making their move, and they will come while going all out, considering what you told us. So, be ready to deploy at a moment's notice in the next few days."

The group stood in stunned silence as they absorbed the news about the appearance of ten new dungeons. The implications hit them like a tidal wave, washing over their already weary spirits. Ten dungeons meant that ten worlds had fallen, and ten heroes had met their demise with them.

The weight of the situation sank deep into their hearts. It was a harsh reminder of the gravity of their mission, the desperate struggle against overwhelming odds. Each dungeon represented a world lost, a hero defeated, and a civilization in ruins. The enormity of the devastation was almost too much to comprehend.

As they contemplated the magnitude of the challenge before them, a somber atmosphere settled over the group. They were acutely aware that the fate of their own world hung in the balance, and the news of these new dungeons only added to the urgency of their quest. The enemy's power seemed insurmountable, their reach extending across multiple worlds.

After the long and arduous journey, the group members dispersed to their respective homes, seeking respite and solace from the battles they had fought. Ethan, too, returned to his own bedroom, seeking a moment of tranquility amidst the turmoil that had consumed his thoughts. He didn't remember his life in the other world being that tiresome, but maybe his memories were playing tricks on him, it was hard to know and he was too tired to care.

However, as he entered his home, he found Luneria waiting for him with her piercing gaze fixed upon him. He sensed a profound understanding in her eyes as if she could see beyond the surface and into the depths of his troubled soul.

"You returned a lot sooner than I had expected… in any case, it seems that your burden is enough to weary even someone like you, huh," Luneria said.

"So, you deal with something like this too?" Ethan asked.

"In my case, I could see numerous futures where my life took place whenever someone conspired against me," Luneria said. "You get used to it after a few hundred years."

Ethan didn't have hundred years to get used to anything. The weight of that realization settled heavily upon Ethan's shoulders. He knew that Luneria possessed an uncanny ability to foresee possible outcomes, including her own demise. It was a gift that came with a heavy price, as it meant that she carried the weight of that knowledge, constantly aware of the fragility of her current existence.

As Emily suddenly appeared in Ethan's room, both Ethan and Luneria were taken aback by her unexpected presence. A frown creased their brows as they exchanged puzzled glances, wondering what had brought Emily to their midst.

Ethan, ever the cautious one, instinctively moved to a defensive posture, his muscles tensing as he assessed the situation. Luneria, with her keen intuition, observed Emily's demeanor, sensing an air of urgency or concern.

"I asked Hannah to send me here since I wanted to learn a bit of time magic from Luneria," Emily explained. "Sorry for bugging in, but this is absolutely necessary for me, so deal with it as I do."

"You said that to my sister?" Ethan furrowed his eyebrows.

"No, I just said that I wanted to see your bird, and she made some misunderstandings of her own," Emily said. "I know what you can do; there is no need to pretend otherwise."

"Nothing good will come if you try to change the past," Luneria said.

"I guess it was only obvious that you would do something like that… didn't you watch any time travel movies until now?" Ethan asked. "It seems that everyone around only wants to do crazy things. It would be easier and more understanding if you wanted world domination or something."

"Even if it isn't possible, I want to learn and find a solution to my current problems," Emily said.

It became evident a long time ago to him that there was a personal dimension to Emily's mission, one that involved the mending of fractured bonds within her own family.

Ethan's gaze shifted towards Emily. He realized that her desire to protect their world went hand in hand with her yearning to heal the wounds of her own past. The divorce of her parents and her subsequent journey to another world had left an indelible mark on her, causing her to mature and return as someone who changed.

"It is up to you, Luneria," Ethan said and then jumped on his bed and began to meditate. "As long as you can tell that she won't cause trouble and that won't get in the way of your tasks, I am fine either way."

As Ethan focused his mana, an ethereal energy enveloped him, causing his skin to undergo a mesmerizing transformation. The color palette shifted, starting with his natural complexion before gradually transitioning through shades of brown and red. Finally, a brilliant silver hue cascaded across his body, forming a protective barrier known as Earthen Armor.

Luneria and Emily stood in awe, their eyes fixated on the shimmering armor that now encased Ethan. The metallic silver radiated strength and resilience, resembling a formidable shield against any threat that may come his way.

Ethan's newfound ability to manifest Earthen Armor spoke of his connection to the elements and his affinity for harnessing the forces of nature. The armor provided not only physical protection but also a deep-rooted connection to the earth, amplifying his strength and fortitude.
