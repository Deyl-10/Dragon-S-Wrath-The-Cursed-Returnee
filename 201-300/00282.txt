Chapter 282 Sources of power

Instead, he clenched his fists, channeling his pain and frustration into a fierce resolve. Each ache, each throb of agony, became fuel for his determination, reminding him of the stakes and the sacrifices that had brought him to this point. Through gritted teeth, he vowed to press on, to face whatever trials awaited him with unwavering resolve.

"Anyway, what is the situation?" Ethan asked. "Did we make any progress on learning what is the cause of all this mess?"

"I have some people looking into it, but we are short-handed, thanks to the dungeons and rifts," John replied. "Our allies in other worlds are also doing some research, but they have never heard of such a thing… where enemies from the past returned from the dead like nothing had happened."

"They returned stronger at that… I was able to kill one of the guys that I defeated before who caused a lot of trouble to me, but he returned twenty percent stronger," Dante replied. "I can tell that much given the experience that I received in both kills."

The enemy had indeed returned stronger, but the increase in power wasn't as immense as he had anticipated. His earlier assessments seemed to have been fairly accurate, albeit with some slight deviations.

Though revived and seemingly more formidable, the doppelganger still fell within the boundaries of what Ethan had predicted. The enemy's strength had certainly increased, but it hadn't skyrocketed to an overwhelming level. This revelation brought both a sense of relief and a renewed determination within Ethan.

"That should be the limit for their bodies and souls to endure such a boost in power," Ian said. "It would be better if they returned just strong enough to kill us, but they aren't, so that kind of effect has such limitations."

"You two brought someone from the dead, and such a thing happened soon after; what do you have to say about this?" John asked.

As the weight of the situation settled upon the group, an air of gloom enveloped the atmosphere. Ian and Anna averted their gazes, their expressions tinged with guilt and uncertainty. The realization that they might have played a role in the revival of the doppelganger hung heavily in the air, demanding answers and explanations.

Ethan could sense the tension and unease emanating from his friends. The knowledge that they had created a potion capable of bringing back the dead, even in a twisted form, raised unsettling questions about the extent of their powers and the consequences of their actions. It was a revelation that struck at the core of their moral compass and tested their understanding of the boundaries of their abilities.

"Asking them is useless," Luneria appeared while she was standing at the top of Milo's head. "Their method to bring someone back from the dead is different. The enemies have their memories, after all. Unlike their mother."

"... A talking bird," John said while furrowing his eyebrows. "Why am I still surprised?"

As Luneria revealed herself, Ethan couldn't help but feel a mixture of surprise and resignation. He knew that her presence added another layer of complexity to an already complicated situation. The circumstances had forced her to emerge from the shadows, and although Ethan had hoped to shield her from the chaos, it seemed that fate had different plans.

With a heavy sigh, Ethan acknowledged that Luneria's involvement was inevitable. Her unique abilities and knowledge made her a valuable asset, particularly in times of uncertainty and turmoil. While he had wanted to spare her from the dangers and hardships they faced, he understood that her insights and guidance could prove invaluable in navigating the challenges that lay ahead.

"I am the guardian of a world that was on the brink of extinction, and I can use some time magic," Luneria said and then flew to the top of Ethan's head. "I will skip the details, but using all the mana I harnessed in the last few days, I was able to see the future and understand the nature of the enemy's power. It is chaos."

As everyone furrowed their eyebrows in perplexity, a deep sense of confusion permeated the atmosphere. They couldn't comprehend how the fundamental force of chaos could be responsible for the resurrection of their enemies. It seemed contrary to their understanding of the natural order and the balance between life and death.

The concept of chaos had always been associated with disorder and unpredictability. Still, the notion that it could wield the power to revive fallen foes challenged their conventional understanding. It was as if the very fabric of reality had been manipulated, defying the natural cycle of life and death.

With a mixture of concern and curiosity, the group exchanged glances, seeking answers that eluded them. They pondered the implications of this newfound revelation, contemplating the extent of chaos's influence and the potential consequences it could bring.

"Let's start with the basic lesson of magic. What do you think magic is?" Luneria asked.

"Energy from spirit and soul," Emily replied.

"Correct, if your spirit is strong enough, you can use magic to alter the physical world," Luneria added. "However, souls and spirits can produce other sources of energy that can also be used. Vengeful spirits are born from the malevolent energy of those who died filled with regrets, and they can affect the physical world."

As Ethan contemplated the nature of the malevolent energy that was now at play, a realization dawned upon him. He understood that this dark and malevolent force while possessing immense power, had a corrupting influence on the mind. It was not a normal or natural energy to wield, for it tainted one's thoughts and intentions.

While mana, the life-giving force of the world, could be harnessed and utilized for various purposes, the malevolent energy was different. It held an inherent darkness that twisted and perverted one's desires, driving them toward chaos and destruction. It was a power that came at a grave cost, for it consumed not only the body but also the very essence of one's being.
