Chapter 256 Self-Imposed

Ethan focused his remaining mana into his sword as he neared the earth's surface. Flames erupted from the blade, consuming it in an intense blaze. The fire burned hotter and fiercer than ever before, fueled by his determination and the mana coursing through his veins.

Ethan hurtled toward the ground like a shooting star, his flaming sword leading the way. As Ethan descended from the sky, his body hurtling towards the enemy camp, a sense of impending destruction filled the air. The ground beneath him quivered, and the wind howled in anticipation of the impact to come.

Ethan collided with the ground with a thunderous crash, unleashing a cataclysmic shockwave of flames that rippled outward in a fiery explosion. The sheer force of the impact obliterated everything in its path, reducing the surrounding area to a smoldering wasteland.

The shockwave radiated with a deafening roar, shattering the tranquility of the night and shaking the very foundations of the enemy camp. Flames engulfed the liches, incinerating them in an instant, their life forces consumed by the inferno.

The heat was searing, scorching the earth, and melting the ice that had once covered the land. The sheer intensity of the flames caused the air to distort, creating a hazy mirage that danced in the aftermath of the attack.

The force of the impact sent shockwaves rippling outward, causing the ground to tremble and the trees to sway violently. The deafening sound echoed for miles, reaching the ears of Ethan's allies, who were stationed kilometers away. Even they felt the ground beneath them quake, a testament to the sheer magnitude of the attack.

In the wake of the fiery onslaught, the enemy forces lay decimated, their ranks reduced to ash and charred remnants. The once formidable liches, known for their dark powers and immortality, had been vanquished in an instant, unable to withstand the overwhelming might of Ethan's fall.

As the smoke and dust settled, the group cautiously approached the aftermath of the devastating attack. Their eyes scanned the battlefield, assessing the impact of Ethan's meteoric descent. What they saw both astonished and troubled them.

Among the remains of the enemy forces, they found a few hundred thousand liches who were still able to move, albeit barely. Their ranks had been decimated, their bodies charred and mangled from the intensity of the flames. The sight was a testament to the destructive power unleashed by Ethan's fall.

Dante and Ian, ever ready for battle, wasted no time in dispatching the remaining enemies. With swift and precise strikes, they eliminated the wounded liches, ensuring that they would no longer pose a threat.

Meanwhile, the rest of the group turned their attention to finding Ethan. Their hearts sank as they witnessed the extent of his injuries. Battered and charred, his arms a twisted mess, Ethan appeared to be in an incredibly dire state. Yet, he remained resolute, his unwavering determination evident in his eyes.

As the group approached, Ethan was in the process of healing his wounds. His innate regenerative abilities slowly repaired the damage inflicted upon his body. It was a painful and arduous process, but he persisted, knowing that his recovery was essential for the battles yet to come.

"You should have said that you would make yourself look like a meteor," Emily said while studying Ethan and healing his wounds.

"A true magician never explains their tricks," Ethan said while showing a weird look in his eyes.

As the group surrounded Ethan, they couldn't help but notice the distant, vacant look in his eyes. It was as if he was simultaneously present and lost in his own thoughts, disconnected from the world around him. The disconcerting expression spoke volumes about the toll of his actions and the weight he carried upon his shoulders.

His gaze seemed to penetrate beyond the physical realm as if searching for answers or grappling with inner demons. It was a glimpse into the depths of his being, a reminder that behind his formidable strength and unwavering resolve, some scars and burdens weighed heavily upon him.

Those who knew Ethan well understood that he was a complex individual, carrying the weight of his past experiences and the responsibility of his abilities. His journey had thrust him into unimaginable situations, forcing him to make difficult choices and endure tremendous hardship.

The others exchanged concerned glances, recognizing that Ethan's internal struggles ran deep. They knew that beneath his seemingly indomitable exterior, he bore the weight of immense power and the consequences that came with it. It was a burden that few could comprehend, and even fewer could share.

The atmosphere within the group had changed. Once known for his light-hearted banter and quick wit, Ethan had become a mere shadow of his former self. The weight of his actions and the toll it had taken on him had left a visible impact on his spirit.

Gone were the boisterous laughter and playful demeanor that used to brighten their darkest moments. In its place was a solemnity, a heaviness that seemed to hang in the air. The once vibrant and energetic individual had retreated into the depths of his own thoughts, leaving behind an emptiness that was hard to ignore.

His friends observed this transformation with concern and a tinge of sadness. They missed the old Ethan, the one who could always lighten the mood and find a way to make even the direst situations seem a little less bleak. They longed for the return of his infectious spirit, hoping to see him emerge from the shadows that seemed to engulf him.

The sudden change in Ethan's demeanor and his inclination towards reckless actions left the group perplexed. They struggled to comprehend the underlying reason behind his behavior. Still, there was a shared realization that it seemed to stem from a more profound need within him. It was as if Ethan found solace in taking on overwhelming challenges, putting himself in harm's way as if it were a form of self-imposed penitence.
