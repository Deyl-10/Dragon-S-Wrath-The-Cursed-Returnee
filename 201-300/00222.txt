Chapter 222 Lightning Armor

Yet, to his astonishment, the giant robots managed to block his attack in time by moving that massive sword.

"He has experience using this thing… I wonder what he fought with that," Ethan asked when he barely avoided the sword strike and was still pushed away by the wind blast.

"That machine was used to hunt several creatures that were the guardians of some tribes," The time silver bird replied. "They weren't as strong as me, but they could win against ordinary foes with ease."

Ethan's heart weighed heavy with a mix of empathy and uncertainty. He understood the cost of war, the toll it took on both sides. The lives lost, the suffering endured—it was a burden that weighed heavily on his conscience. He questioned whether he should be the arbiter of fate, the one to decide the future of this world.

Yet, as he delved deeper into the history of this land, his hesitation began to wane. Tales of oppression, suppression, and a ruthless thirst for power emerged from the annals of time. With all its grandeur and prosperity, it became apparent that the current society was built upon the corpses and shattered dreams of those who had dared to oppose it.

The truth revealed itself, casting a stark light upon the path Ethan had chosen. He could no longer turn a blind eye to the dark underbelly of this civilization. The realization that their current society was a facade constructed upon the broken backs of dissenters fueled his resolve. He could no longer hold back.

"I can help you one more time before I run out of energy," The time silver bird said. "I need the rest to restore the world to a new and appropriate starting point."

"No need, I got this," Ethan declared.

As Ethan pressed forward, his battered body and weary spirit spoke volumes of the hardships he had endured. The wounds that adorned his form served as a testament to the immense struggle he had faced. It was clear to anyone who beheld him that he needed assistance, that the weight of the world he carried threatened to crush him.

In the midst of this realization, the time silver bird observed Ethan closely, its ancient eyes filled with a mix of curiosity and concern. The creature understood the precariousness of the situation, and though it possessed wisdom far beyond that of mortals, it hesitated to intervene. It knew that Ethan's confidence and resolve had led him thus far, and it remained uncertain whether his perceived need for help was genuine or a product of his own exhaustion.

Before the enemy could attack again, Ethan decided to put a certain idea into action. If the layer of Mana Force that surrounds his body was like all of his buffs combined on him, what would happen if he gave another purpose to it? It wouldn't become a layer that would make him increase his mana pool, but it definitely would be something else.

Just changing the purpose wasn't enough, either. He had to find the right thing to do… The enemy approached to attack again, and then Ethan closed his eyes and covered his body with the mana; then he tried to use Electric Enchantment using that layer of energy.

Congratulations! You learned the skill Lightning Armor.

I think you should take a look at

Lightning Armor: at the cost of one hundred points of mana per second, you can get a massive boost of speed that will be equal to the level of the skill multiplied by twenty. However, you might suffer damage if your Electric Resistance is lower than the level of the skill.

Ethan used his skill points to make the lightning armor level up in the blink of an eye. In that short window of time, he moved to the side and completely avoided the hit. It was insane, but his speed doubled with that alone.

As Ethan's battles raged on, a surge of raw power coursed through his veins. In a dazzling display of arcane mastery, his body became enveloped in a shimmering armor forged from the very essence of mana. This ethereal armor crackled and danced with energy, resembling bolts of lightning frozen in time.

The armor, a manifestation of his indomitable will and magical prowess, clung to his form like a second skin. It radiated an otherworldly brilliance, illuminating the surrounding darkness with its pulsating glow. Each intricate detail of the armor seemed to be intricately woven from the raw fabric of mana, giving it an almost living quality.

"Well, that was easy… but I don't have time to think too much about this," Ethan thought.

In the midst of the chaos and his burning determination, Ethan's focus intensified to an extraordinary level. The surging anger within him acted as a catalyst, empowering his connection to the raw wellspring of mana that coursed through his being. In this heightened state, he found himself effortlessly manipulating the arcane forces around him, pushing the boundaries of his own abilities.

In the heat of the moment, a spark of inspiration ignited within Ethan. A surge of energy pulsed through his veins as he channeled his focus into a specific intent.

Drawing upon his connection with the primal forces of magic, he forged a new skill, a technique born of his own resolve and the unyielding currents of his mana.

The enemy's surprise was evident as they witnessed Ethan employing a new technique, one that made him significantly faster. His focus and anger had honed his control over mana, allowing him to move with unparalleled speed and agility.

With his newfound quickness, Ethan's movements became a blur of motion, leaving the enemy struggling to keep up. He darted across the battlefield like a streak of lightning, evading their attacks effortlessly and launching precise counterattacks.

The enemy, who had relied on their superior strength and size, found themselves outmatched by Ethan's swift maneuvers. They attempted to react, but their efforts were in vain as Ethan's rapid strikes kept them off balance. The speed at which he moved seemed almost supernatural, catching them off guard at every turn.
