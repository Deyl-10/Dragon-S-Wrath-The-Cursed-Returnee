Chapter 284 Final Battle (2)

"That is all fine and dandy, but that doesn't explain how the enemies were brought back to life and stronger at that," Ethan said. "I can only guess that it is some kind of response to the summoning of people like us."

"You are almost completely correct," Luneria said. "Everything has order and balance, even the balance between chaos and order. So, when the will of the world began to act, it disrupted the natural flow of things. Until now, chaos was fed with all deaths that happened when they weren't supposed to happen. Deaths, violence, greed, lust… all those things fed chaos until now. However, the feeding process decreased thanks to your arrivals. The arrivals of all of you, chaos itself bringing back the enemies that you fought it is some sort of correction to make things return to normal."

As the group contemplated their roles and the complexities of their situation, a collective sigh escaped their lips. They understood that they couldn't solely blame themselves for the predicament they found themselves in. After all, their primary mission was to save lives and restore balance to the worlds they were summoned to. It was a duty they had willingly undertaken, driven by their compassion and desire to make a difference.

However, the realization dawned upon them that their actions, while well-intentioned, also played a part in perpetuating the cycle of dependency. By constantly intervening and cleaning up the messes left behind by others, they inadvertently contributed to a system where their presence was expected and chaos could persist.

They understood that allowing chaos to reign unchecked was not the answer either. The innocent lives at stake and the potential devastation that chaos could unleash were too great to ignore. Their abilities and powers were meant to be used for good, to protect the weak and restore order.

"So… to get rid of the enemies or to make them stop coming endlessly like they are spawning monsters from a game, we have to get rid of chaos?" Ian asked. "Something that is entirely not physical and is a real aspect of reality?"

"Chaos is very real and has physical form, you just need to head to the right place, time, and dimension to find it," Luneria explained. "I saw that in the future, you guys were heading there, but after that, nothing. I can't see beyond it."

The possibilities for that were numerous. Luneria's vision might be blocked or disrupted by external forces. It could be the result of powerful beings or entities deliberately concealing their plans or manipulating the threads of fate. This could be an intentional act to create uncertainty and hinder the group's ability to predict future events.

The fabric of time itself could be distorted or manipulated, making it difficult for Luneria to perceive the future accurately. Time-based anomalies or disturbances in the space-time continuum could create ripples that disrupt the flow of information from the future, obscuring it from her sight.

The cessation of Luneria's foresight could signify the arrival of a formidable and enigmatic adversary. This adversary may possess abilities or knowledge that render their actions unpredictable and impervious to precognitive abilities. Their presence could signify a new phase in the group's journey, one that demands heightened vigilance and adaptability.

"We should head there immediately, we aren't going to receive an invitation," Ethan said. "Wasting time dealing with the small fries will be the same as helping them get stronger."

"Yes, you are right, but the future I saw, I was the one who opened the portal to the dimension where you can find the source of chaos with the help of your sister," Luneria said. "I control time, and she controls space… we will need stupids amounts of mana as well."

"I see… it might also take some time for you two to be able to open the portal again," Ethan said while nodding. "We won't be able to bring a lot of people with us since it will leave this side defenseless."

The mission to defeat or weaken chaos was undoubtedly a daunting task, with numerous challenges and obstacles ahead. The constraints of time, resources, and the sheer magnitude of the enemy's power stacked the odds against the humans. It was a race against time to prevent further devastation and restore balance to the worlds they inhabited.

The fight against chaos required not only physical strength but also strategic planning, unity, and perseverance. It demanded a deep understanding of the enemy's tactics, weaknesses, and the underlying nature of chaos itself. It was an ongoing battle that required continuous adaptation and innovation.

The scarcity of resources added an additional layer of difficulty. The humans needed to carefully allocate and manage their limited resources, making the most out of what they had. Each decision had to be weighed against its potential impact on the overall mission. It required prioritization, sacrifice, and efficient utilization of available assets.

Ethan sat down in a secluded spot, his mind focused and determined. Despite the overwhelming challenges they faced, he knew that he needed to do everything in his power to improve their chances against chaos. Training was one aspect he could directly control and invest his efforts into.

He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath to center himself. The weight of responsibility pressed upon him, but he let it fuel his determination rather than overwhelm him. He knew that every moment spent training was a step closer to honing his skills, increasing his power, and becoming a stronger ally in the battle against chaos.

"I will spread the information to some people that will make good use of it," Dante declared. "How much time do you guys need to have enough mana?"

"One month's worth of mana should be enough," Luneria replied.

"I can't stock that much mana inside me," Hannah said.

"We will do something about it," Luneria said.

The situation was quickly escalating, but the group was almost ready to move and they knew that they were fast approaching a turning point.
