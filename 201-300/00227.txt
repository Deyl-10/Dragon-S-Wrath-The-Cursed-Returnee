Chapter 227 Ritual

While the world was changing, Ethan returned to the starting point alongside Numeria and saw the magic circle that brought him still there. Without any hesitation, he jumped in, and then the magic circle began to glow before he was sent to Ivan's base.

Ethan returned much sooner than Ivan and Anna had anticipated, accompanied by a miniature version of the Time Silver Bird perched on his shoulder. Their astonishment was evident as they observed the unusual sight.

Ivan and Anna exchanged glances, their surprise mingled with concern for Ethan's well-being. They had expected him to face significant challenges and dangers on his journey. Still, the presence of the miniature Time Silver Bird raised more questions than answers.

"I am too tired to explain anything," Ethan said and then took the magic feather from his inventory. "Long story short, this is Luneria, and she is some kind of pet now."

"I would be grateful if you weren't to introduce me like that," Luneria said. "I lost most of my powers, but I am still a guardian of a world, and that position requires some respect."

"Anyway, just hurry up," Ethan said. "The others should arrive at any moment, and I don't want to lift a single more finger during this mission."

Despite the gains and accomplishments throughout the mission, Ethan couldn't deny the exhaustion that permeated his body. He had pushed himself relentlessly, working tirelessly to overcome countless obstacles and face unimaginable challenges. Like a horse, he had carried the weight of responsibility on his shoulders, constantly striving to protect and make a difference.

The weariness settled deep within his bones, aching and demanding respite. Every muscle screamed for rest, and even his indomitable spirit felt drained. The physical and mental toll of his efforts had taken its toll, leaving him longing for a moment of respite, a chance to recharge and rejuvenate.

With a shared sense of purpose, Ivan and Anna turned their attention to the final adjustments needed for the ritual. They understood the urgency of their task and the significance of their roles in bringing about the desired outcome.

Side by side, they meticulously examined the intricate details of the ritual, ensuring that every element was in place and every step accounted for. They were a well-practiced team, their synergy evident in the seamless coordination of their actions.

As they labored, the room hummed with a palpable energy, the air thick with anticipation. Each movement, each adjustment, brought them one step closer to the culmination of their efforts. They knew that the success of the ritual hinged on their meticulousness and attention to detail.

The feather was placed gently above the body of Ivan's wife. As he released his grip, the feather floated down, its ethereal glow casting a soft, warm light upon the lifeless form. Slowly, the radiant energy of the feather began to weave its magic, enveloping the body in a gentle embrace.

When the ritual was about to start, Ian suddenly woke up and looked around in surprise. At first, he readied himself to fight Ethan, but soon he found the annoyance on his face and changed his mind.

"... It seems that a lot happened while I was asleep," Ian said while furrowing his eyebrows and recognizing the time silver bird. "Dude… don't you think that a kick on the balls was overkill."

I think you should take a look at

"No way, I was planning ten kicks, but you have less backbone than a cockroach," Ethan replied. "You should be thankful that you are alive, considering that you tried to stab me in the neck."

"... I will make up for it someday," Ian said while looking away and showing a complicated expression.

"That is very unlikely," Ethan said.

The memory of Ian's betrayal, of his attempt to end Ethan's life, regardless of the circumstances or reasons behind it. Regardless of the reasoning, the fact remained that Ian had tried to take his life. The weight of that betrayal lingered, serving as a constant reminder of the complexities and uncertainties of human relationships. It was a reminder that even in the face of a shared purpose and common cause, the bonds of trust could be broken, and loyalty could falter.

The ritual started, and all the machines around the base began to work while emitting a soft blue glow toward the capsule where Ian's mother was.

Ivan made the feather be absorbed by his wife's body, and then it began to glow while emitting a pale silver glue… it seemed that it was working, but Ethan didn't think that it would be that easy.

"What are the chances of this working?" Ethan asked.

"I lost my powers, so I can't see the future anymore," Luneria said. "There are many methods for one to revive the dead and attain immortality. However, they usually are the culmination of a world's magic and technology. What is being done here is a combination of many things."

The magic infused within the machines resonated with a pulsating energy, intertwining with the essence of life itself. A soft glow emanated from the feather, growing brighter and more radiant with each passing moment.

As the surrounding area bathed in the ethereal light, a surge of vitality surged forth, breathing new life into the stillness that had enveloped Ivan's wife. The gentle hum of machinery harmonized with the rhythmic beats of her heart, creating a symphony of existence that filled the air.

In that transcendent moment, her body stirred, a subtle movement rippling through her limbs. It was as if a dormant flame had been reignited, flickering with the promise of renewed vitality. The feather, now pulsating with an otherworldly brilliance, seemed to guide the awakening process, guiding the flow of energy and weaving it into every fiber of her being.

The light intensified, enveloping Ivan's wife in a radiant aura as if the very essence of life itself was reclaiming its rightful place within her. Shadows danced and dissolved, replaced by the effervescent glow of rejuvenation. It was a moment of pure magic where the boundaries between life and the ethereal realm blurred and merged.
