Chapter 272 Demi-Tyrants

Ethan's knowledge of enchanting magic revolved around the creation and imbuing of magic items with specific properties and abilities. He understood that enchanting involves infusing ordinary objects with magical energy, granting them enhanced properties or abilities beyond their original capabilities.

In the realm of enchanting, Ethan knew that certain materials and substances were commonly used as conduits for magic. Gemstones, rare metals, and magical essences were often employed as key components in the enchanting process. These materials acted as vessels for storing and channeling magical energy, enabling the creation of powerful and intricate enchantments.

Ethan was aware that the enchanting process required a combination of technical skill, knowledge of magical theory, and a deep understanding of the intended purpose and desired effect of the enchanted item. By carefully manipulating and harnessing magical energy, enchanters could imbue objects with a wide range of properties, such as increased strength, enhanced protection, elemental affinities, or even the ability to cast specific spells.

The connection between Ethan's ability to drain mana and enchanting items can be seen as a two-sided process. On one hand, Ethan's ability to drain mana allows him to absorb and utilize magical energy from his surroundings or opponents. This ability provides him with a direct source of mana that he can harness for various purposes, such as enhancing his own abilities or launching powerful attacks.

On the other hand, enchanting items involves infusing objects with magical energy to imbue them with specific properties or abilities. This process typically requires the enchanter to channel their own mana into the item during the enchantment process. The enchanter acts as a conduit, transferring their own magical energy into the object and shaping it according to their desired enchantment.

In this sense, Ethan's ability to drain mana can be seen as the reverse of the traditional enchanting process. Instead of channeling his mana into an object to create an enchantment, he draws mana from his opponents and utilizes it for his own purposes. This ability allows him to tap into a readily available source of magical energy without the need for intricate, enchanting rituals or materials.

"I will see what I can do when I have time, but it feels quite far-fetched," Ethan shrugged.

"Oh, yeah? Just give me a few days to think of a theory," Emily said. "Your curse makes me recall something like a magnet; you just didn't find the right way to use it to emit the right waves to oppose what you don't want or need."

That gave Ethan an idea, but he decided not to say it out loud since it could mean just false hope. In any case, he had to put that aside for now since Hannah finally contacted them.

"I am going to teleport you all to my workplace," Hannah suddenly said.

Before Ethan or Emily could say anything, they were teleported. As Ethan, Emily, Ian, Mary, and Anna appeared before Hannah, they couldn't help but notice the exhaustion etched on her face. Her usually sharp eyes seemed dull and unfocused as if she had been deprived of sleep and rest for an extended period of time. The lines of worry and fatigue were etched deeply on her features, a testament to her immense burden.

Ethan's concern grew as he observed Hannah, realizing that the situation must be dire if it had taken such a toll on her. He knew she was a strong and capable woman, but even the strongest have their limits. He exchanged a worried glance with the others, silently acknowledging the gravity of the situation they found themselves in.

"Do you want to overwork yourself to death?" Ethan asked.

"It is fine… I will have a break after this," Hannah said while showing a dismissive gesture. "Nuvian is coming, and he is good at giving massages that relieve fatigue."

"Don't make your younger brother imagine weird scenes in which you are involved," Ethan furrowed his eyebrows.

"... Enough with the jokes," Hannah said. "Things in the country are under control now, but the whole world is going crazy. Moreover, some massive armies appeared on the southern side of the continent, and reaching that area was difficult. Dante and Aline have been sent there, but they are having a hard time dealing with the enemies by themselves."

"They must be quite the enemies… or is Dante holding back?" Ian asked with a serious expression.

The group couldn't help but notice the contrast between Dante's previous displays of power and his current struggle. They had witnessed him easily decimate armies of demons, his sword swinging effortlessly as he carved a path of destruction. It was bewildering to see him now, grappling with the challenges they faced.

Ethan, in particular, pondered this perplexing situation. Dante possessed immense strength and skill, capable of singlehandedly wiping out hordes of enemies. It didn't make sense that he would be facing difficulties now. There had to be something more to it.

"They are doing their best, but they are facing the armies of two worlds that began to emerge on the same spot," Hannah said after she sat down. "One of the armies came from the world that Dante saved. He had supposedly eliminated those creatures, so he was surprised to see them again as if they had been revived."

Ethan and Emily exchanged surprised glances as they absorbed the disheartening news. The realization that the enemies Dante had once triumphed over were now resurrected filled them with a sense of unease. It was an ominous development that sent shivers down their spines.

Ethan's mind raced with possibilities, his thoughts delving into the implications of this unsettling revelation. He couldn't help but wonder about the purpose behind resurrecting defeated foes. It hinted at a sinister force at work, one that sought to undermine their efforts and sow despair. A deep premonition settled within him, warning of the challenges they would face.

"What are they?" Emily asked. "The same thing happened to me."

"They are demi-tyrants, very difficult targets," Hannah replied.
