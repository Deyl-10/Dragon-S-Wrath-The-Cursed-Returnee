Chapter 263 Counter Attack

As Ethan delivered powerful blows, crushing the heads of the remaining enemies outside the parking lot, he noticed something unusual within the confines of the space. Amidst the chaos and destruction, his attention was drawn to a shimmering fissure, crackling with silver energy and adorned with a red border.

Curiosity mingled with a sense of caution as Ethan approached the fissure. He could feel the raw power emanating from it, resonating with an otherworldly energy. It was a gateway, a portal of some kind, presenting an opportunity to venture into uncharted territory.

As he neared the fissure, the air around it seemed to distort, creating a surreal and almost surreal atmosphere. The swirling energies within the rift beckoned, whispering promises of unknown realms and potential dangers. Ethan's instincts warned him of the uncertainty that lay beyond, but his determination pushed him forward.

"This isn't like the end of a dungeonâ€¦ this link between two worlds is suspicious," Ethan rubbed his chin thoughtfully.

Unlike the stable and discreet dungeon portals Ethan had encountered before, the time rift he now stood before was noticeably different. Its shimmering presence was visible, pulsating with unstable energy that seemed to distort the surrounding space.

The rift's unique nature intrigued Ethan as it deviated from the usual patterns of dungeon portals. It is visibility, and erratic behavior suggested a level of unpredictability that demanded caution and careful navigation.

As he observed the rift, Ethan couldn't help but ponder the implications of its existence. Was it a natural occurrence, a result of some cosmic anomaly, or the deliberate work of powerful beings manipulating time and space? The answers remained shrouded in mystery, fueling his curiosity and driving him to explore further.

As Ethan stood before the time rift, his keen intuition and understanding of the supernatural led him to a realization. He surmised that the emergence of monsters and the appearance of rifts were not coincidental occurrences. Instead, he saw a connection between the rising levels of mana on Earth and the sudden appearance of these portals.

Drawing on his knowledge and experiences, Ethan deduced that the mana surges were attracting monsters to specific locations rich in magical energy. These hotspots acted as beacons, drawing the creatures from other realms and dimensions to converge upon them. The bases of monsters, with their abundant reservoirs of mana, became focal points for the rifts to manifest.

Ethan's hypothesis was further strengthened when he considered the implications of these mana surges. The increased mana levels could be attributed to various factors, such as the awakening of ancient artifacts, the gathering of magical practitioners, or even the disruption of natural energy flows. Regardless of the cause, the consequence was clear: heightened mana levels acted as a magnet, pulling monsters towards Earth and triggering the appearance of time rifts.

Considering the nature of the time rifts and their connection to the surge of monsters, Ethan concluded that someone or something had intentionally opened this rift in that particular location. The calculated nature of its manifestation suggested a deliberate action rather than a random occurrence.

Driven by his intuition, Ethan resolved to uncover the truth behind this mysterious event. He knew that finding the origin of the rift would provide valuable insights into the forces at play and potentially lead him to those responsible. It was a puzzle he was determined to solve, no matter the risks or challenges that lay ahead.

"Luneria, I am going to pass some images of what I am seeing to you," Ethan said via Telepathy. "What do you think of this?"

"I am amazed that you can use telepathy this well when you are a plain warrior," Luneria said. "If I have to guess, I can only imagine that someone left in the place you are a link to the world of the monsters that you faced."

Ethan's thoughts drifted to the missing students who had aligned themselves with the enemies. Their sudden disappearance raised suspicions within him, leading him to suspect their involvement in the creation of the unstable rifts.

Recalling the events that unfolded prior to their disappearance, Ethan pieced together fragments of information and clues. It seemed apparent that these students had delved deeper into forbidden knowledge, dabbling in dark arts and forbidden rituals. Their thirst for power and ambition had driven them down a treacherous path, one that ultimately led them to join the enemy's ranks.

"What can I do to close this? I can't see any relic around," Ethan said.

"Considering your power, you can probably close the rift with your bare hands," Luneria said.

The idea of closing the rift with his hands alone seemed almost too simple, too straightforward for a problem of this magnitude. But something inside him urged him to try, to reach out and harness the power within.

With a deep breath, Ethan extended his hands towards the rift, his palms facing the unstable energy that crackled and pulsed within. The air around him grew charged with anticipation as he summoned every ounce of his willpower, tapping into the depths of his inner strength.

As his fingertips made contact with the swirling energies, a surge of power coursed through his veins. The raw mana of the rift resonated with Ethan's own essence, intertwining and merging as if they were destined to unite. He felt a profound connection, an understanding of the rift's nature and purpose.

A sense of accomplishment washed over Ethan as the last traces of the rift dissipated. The once unstable portal had been sealed, its threat eliminated. He couldn't help but feel a surge of pride at his ability to harness and manipulate the powerful forces at play.

But even as he celebrated this small victory, Ethan knew that there were still greater challenges ahead. The rift was just a symptom of a larger problem, one that required his unwavering determination and the cooperation of his allies to overcome.

"Hannah, I closed the rift after I dealt with the enemies," Ethan said while he used his communicator.

"You did?" Hannah asked the shock visibly in her voice.
