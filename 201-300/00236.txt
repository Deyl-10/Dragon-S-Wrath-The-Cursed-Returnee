Chapter 236 Analysis

The group crossed the space-time tunnel for a while; it seemed that they were going to stay there for a while. Thanks to it, Ethan wondered if his sister would be fine after teleporting five people to the other side of the galaxy.

Regardless, Ethan didn't have time to think about that since he felt his instincts warning him… there was something ahead waiting for them.

As the group landed in the throne room, Ethan couldn't help but feel a sense of déjà vu wash over him. The familiarity of the surroundings brought back memories of his previous summons, a year and a half ago when his journey had first begun.

The grandeur of the throne room was evident in its opulent architecture and exquisite decorations. Ethan's gaze swept across the room, taking in the regal furnishings, intricate tapestries, and the majestic throne that stood at the far end. It was a sight that resonated with both awe and weariness within him.

He let out a silent sigh, reflecting on the long and challenging path he had traversed since that initial summons. The trials, battles, and sacrifices he had endured seemed to converge in this very moment as if fate had led him back to this symbolic familiar and unknown starting point.

Ethan forgot about everything else as he saw Mary standing behind the group. His attention was instantly grabbed by her presence. But his focus quickly shifted when he noticed an old man wearing a crown, accompanied by a middle-aged woman, in the throne room.

His heart sank when the guards, who were supposed to protect the royals, suddenly turned on their own comrades. Without warning, they mercilessly attacked, slashing their throats in a horrifying display of betrayal. The room was stained with blood, and the air was filled with shock and disbelief.

Mary, just a young girl, trembled in fear, her innocence shattered by the gruesome scene. Ethan's instincts kicked in, compelling him to shield her from the unfolding horror. He positioned himself between her and the chaos, determined to keep her safe.

Ethan's eyes burned with anger as he witnessed the betrayal unfolding before him. The guards, who were once entrusted with protecting their world, had now become their enemies. A surge of rage coursed through his veins, fueling his determination to fight back.

"Don't kill them; I can extract all of their memories," Ethan declared.

Without hesitation, Ethan and Dante lunged into action, their movements a blur of strength and precision. They unleashed a flurry of strikes, their fists, and feet finding their targets with deadly accuracy. The sound of bone meeting bone reverberated through the throne room as they unleashed their pent-up frustration.

Their attacks were swift and relentless, a testament to their honed skills and unwavering resolve. Each blow landed with force, sending the traitorous guards sprawling to the ground. Ethan's fists were like lightning, striking with precision and overwhelming power. Dante, with his calculated movements, dispatched his foes with a deadly grace.

Dante nodded and put away his sword. He punched a bunch of the enemies, and that had been enough to completely knock them down. When Dante looked to the side, he saw the ground emitting smoke in the area that Ethan had crossed. The air was vibrating around him while he was grabbing the necks of two royal guards.

Once he was done with the enemies, Ethan closed his eyes and then began to analyze their memories.

Ethan examined the memories of the royal guards, absorbing their recollections and powers. Within those memories, he discovered a significant event that occurred about a month ago—an encounter in a forest south of the city. A cloaked figure had engaged in a conversation with the guards, making a sinister offer. If the guards were to carry out the unthinkable act of assassinating the royal family and the summoned hero, their country would be spared from destruction.

Ethan gathered his friends around him, sharing the unsettling revelation he had unraveled. The gravity of the situation weighed heavily on their minds. They understood the enormity of the task before them—to expose the treachery behind the cloaked figure's plan and protect their world from further harm.

"Can't you give more details?" Emily asked.

"It will take some time to analyze all the memories; this was just the most important one," Ethan said.

The danger loomed ominously, casting a shadow over their every move. While Aline worked tirelessly to calm Mary's frayed nerves, Ethan couldn't help but feel a lingering sense of unease. The treachery they had witnessed served as a stark reminder that more enemies could be lurking in the shadows, ready to strike at any moment.

Ian stood ever watchful, his gaze sweeping the surroundings with a vigilant intensity. His instincts honed by years of training, he remained on high alert, attuned to even the slightest hint of danger. The weight of responsibility rested upon his shoulders as he guarded against any potential threats that might emerge.

"If the royal guards managed to pull this off with ease, then we can agree that this world is in a worse situation than we imagined," Dante said. "The corruption probably has widespread, and we can't trust anyone around. Aline and Emily try to help Mary understand her powers. Ian and I will keep guard on the surroundings while Ethan uses his powers to gather intel about the current state of this world."

As Ethan delved into the memories of the enemies, he uncovered a dark and troubling truth about the world they had been summoned to. The country they found themselves in was the last remaining stronghold in a world ravaged by war and destruction.

The memories revealed that the other nations had undergone a sudden and mysterious transformation. Their leaders had turned their people into horrifying creatures like liches and vampires, using them as tools of warfare. The once-peaceful lands were now engulfed in chaos and despair.
