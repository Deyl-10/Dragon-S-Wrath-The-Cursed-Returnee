Chapter 281 Tough Nut To Crack

Chapter 281 Tough nut to crack

The beam of energy surged forward with unstoppable force, carving through the air like a fiery lance. It struck the ground with a thunderous impact, unleashing a cataclysmic explosion that echoed throughout the surrounding landscape. The earth quivered beneath the immense power as a massive shockwave expanded outward, ripping through trees, shattering rocks, and reducing anything in its path to a smoldering wreckage.

As the fiery tempest subsided, a swirling vortex of crimson energy engulfed the area, forming a menacing sphere of destruction. The blast's ferocity tore through the mountain range, crumbling massive peaks and sending cascades of debris hurtling into the sky. The once-majestic landscape was now transformed into a desolate wasteland, scarred by the unleashed power of the attack.

Ethan's body bore the scars of the devastating assault. His clothes were torn and charred, clinging to his battered frame. Ash and soot-stained his skin, mingling with the sweat and blood that adorned his battle-worn features. Bruises and cuts marred his once unblemished complexion, testaments to the immense power he had withstood.

His limbs trembled with exhaustion, muscles strained and aching from the intense battle. The impact of the attack had taken its toll, leaving him with a lingering sense of weakness. Every breath felt like a struggle, his chest rising and falling with effort.

"Ugh, I am not really not fit to play the role of a hero," Ethan muttered while his body was screaming in agony.

However, Ethan's hell was just starting. Ethan felt a shiver run down his spine, and then the sky in the south glowed red, and then another attack came. The demon king wasn't joking.

"Fuck…" Ethan said.

As Ethan struggled to rise from the wreckage of the previous attack, he felt a searing pain rip through his body once again. The malevolent beam of red energy struck him with unforgiving force, engulfing him in a cataclysmic explosion of power.

The impact sent Ethan hurtling through the air, his body spiraling uncontrollably. Waves of excruciating pain coursed through every fiber of his being, threatening to shatter his resolve. His senses were overwhelmed by the sheer intensity of the attack, his vision clouded by a blinding red light.

His body contorted in agony as the destructive force surged through him, tearing at his flesh and testing the limits of his endurance. Bones cracked and splintered under the immense pressure, and his muscles strained and screamed in protest.

"... It will be so refreshing to kill you yet again," Ethan muttered under his breath.

As the smoke cleared and the echoes of the devastating attack faded into the distance, Ethan found himself standing in the midst of the familiar surroundings where Hannah worked. His senses slowly regained focus, and he took in the sight of his friends gathered around him.

There was Emily, her expression a mix of concern and relief, her hands brimming with healing energy, ready to tend to his wounds. Hannah stood nearby, her eyes filled with a mixture of worry and admiration for her brother's unwavering determination. Ian, Mary, and Anna wore expressions of both relief and concern, their unwavering loyalty to their friend evident in their eyes.

"You are truly reckless," Hannah said.

Emily and Aline approached to heal Ethan since he fell on his knees while emitting steam through his whole body. As Ethan's weary gaze scanned the room, his eyes widened in tired surprise as he spotted Nuvian and John among the familiar faces.

Upon seeing them, Ethan couldn't help but feel a mix of conflicting emotions. On one hand, their presence brought a sense of relief and reassurance. He knew that his arrival, Nuvian's vast knowledge and magical prowess, meant that he , too, recognized the gravity of the situation and was ready to stand alongside Ethan and his friends.

"What is this… healing magic is barely working," Aline furrowed her eyebrows in shock. "A smell and this weird sense is also coming from the wounds."

"He never said the name, but I call it Death Laser Beam," Ethan replied. "It is a mix of mana and malevolent energy. Thanks to its nature, it is a perfect counter for healing magic, but it should return to normal in a couple of hours."

As the commotion subsided and the group gathered in the area where Hannah worked, the sudden arrival of Ethan's parents added a new layer of concern to the already tense atmosphere. Ethan's mother, Evelyn, arrived with a mix of fear and worry etched across her face, her eyes widening in shock as she took in the sight before her.

Ethan, battered and bruised, stood in the midst of his friends and allies, his body showing the unmistakable signs of a fierce battle. His torn clothes, scorched skin, and bloodied wounds painted a vivid picture of the hardships he had endured. It was a sight that no parent should have to witness.

Evelyn's eyes welled up with tears as she took in the full extent of her son's injuries. The shock and emotional turmoil became too much for her, and her legs gave way beneath her. In a swift motion, Ethan's father, Michael, rushed to her side, catching her in his arms just in time to prevent her from hitting the ground.

"... Sorry about that, Dad," Ethan said when his father prevented Evelyn's fall.

"... It is all right; she used to faint a lot in the past," Michael said. "I guess I raised you to become a tough nut to crack if even those wounds aren't bothering you."

As Ethan's exhausted body screamed with pain and weariness, there was a part of him that longed to let go, to release the heavy burden that weighed upon his shoulders. A wave of intense discomfort rippled through every fiber of his being, making it difficult to hold back the tears that threatened to spill from his eyes.

Despite all that, it couldn't be compared to the pain his soul was feeling... he was used to get hurt, but not letting such a thing bother his family was a bit too much he could handle.
