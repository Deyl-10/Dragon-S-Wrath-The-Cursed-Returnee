Chapter 214 Last Bastion

Ethan's display of power and his ability to make their ally vanish had shaken their confidence. They now understood that he possessed skills and abilities far beyond their initial estimation. The remaining robots hesitated, their metallic forms seemingly frozen in contemplation of the newfound threat before them.

With a resolute determination, Ethan prepared to take advantage of their momentary pause. He assessed his opponents, searching for any weaknesses or vulnerabilities in their imposing structures. His mind raced, formulating a strategy to dismantle these colossal adversaries and tip the scales in his favor.

"I want to kill all of them for getting in my way, but I don't have time for this," Ethan said and then dashed in the opposite direction. "Smell ya later."

Despite the allure of acquiring an intact giant robot, Ethan understood the need to exercise caution and not overstay his welcome. While the idea of commandeering such a powerful machine seemed tempting, he recognized the potential consequences and risks involved.

The giant robots, though weakened by his relentless assault, still possessed formidable capabilities. If he were to linger and attempt to commandeer one, it could lead to a prolonged battle with unforeseen reinforcements or countermeasures. Such an extended engagement could put him at a disadvantage, exposing him to further danger and potential capture.

Ethan weighed the risks and rewards in his mind, knowing that his primary objective lay elsewhere. His focus remained fixed on his ultimate mission, and getting entangled in a protracted conflict with the giant robots would only divert him from his purpose.

As Ethan made his decisive exit from the area, he couldn't help but sense a lingering presence of hostility. Although the giant robots themselves did not pursue him, it became apparent that the city's defenses were not so easily thwarted. Mana cannons unleashed powerful beams of energy in his direction from the tops of the towering buildings.

Reacting swiftly, Ethan raised his hands to shield himself from the incoming onslaught. The intense beams crashed against his hands, causing a violent discharge of energy. As the cannons continued their relentless assault, Ethan focused his concentration and tapped into his own well of mana.

With each blast, Ethan absorbed the energy unleashed by the cannons. His hands acted as conduits, channeling the powerful mana into his own being. The sheer force of the energy surged through him, charging his very essence and empowering him further.

As the assault continued, the cannons fired with increasing intensity as if desperate to eliminate the threat Ethan posed. But with each blast, Ethan's resolve only grew stronger, his determination unwavering. The absorbed mana merged with his own, enhancing his abilities and fortifying his spirit.

"Thanks for the meal," Ethan said while looking at the palm of his hands that were emitting steam.

As Ethan traversed the city, he couldn't help but be awestruck by its vastness. The urban landscape stretched out before him, extending far beyond what he had initially anticipated. Buildings towered into the sky, their imposing structures reaching dizzying heights. The streets seemed to stretch on endlessly, snaking through the city like veins.

Hour after hour, Ethan moved through the labyrinthine streets, navigating the maze-like network of roads and alleys. Every corner turned revealed more of the city's expanse, with towering structures lining the way, their windows like countless eyes observing his every move.

The sheer scale of the city was overwhelming, its magnitude dwarfing anything Ethan had encountered before. The streets were lined with rows upon rows of buildings, their facades reflecting a blend of architectural styles from different eras. Some structures exuded an air of grandeur and opulence, adorned with intricate designs and embellishments. In contrast, others appeared more utilitarian, their functionality taking precedence over aesthetics.

As Ethan ventured further into the city, his assumption that all the people in this world lived within its confines grew stronger. The bustling streets, the towering buildings, and the constant hum of activity all hinted at a dense population that thrived within these walls. The realization weighed on him, highlighting the potential scale of the challenges he would face.

After covering a staggering distance of two hundred kilometers, Ethan finally reached what seemed to be the outskirts of the city. However, to his surprise, he discovered that the city extended even further, wrapping around the area ahead like a colossal embrace. The realization left him astounded as if he had stumbled upon a secret that had been carefully concealed.

The urban sprawl seemed never-ending, stretching out into the distance as far as the eye could see. It was as if the city had woven itself into the very fabric of the land, blending seamlessly with the natural surroundings. The structures appeared to meld with the landscape, creating an amalgamation of concrete and nature that was both captivating and perplexing.

"I guess the time silver bird lived in this area, and the city was built around it for some reason," Ethan thought.

The green area served as a sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of city life. Towering trees, their branches reaching skyward, provided shade and shelter. Lush grasses and colorful flowers carpeted the ground, creating a tapestry of natural beauty. Birds chirped melodiously, their songs intertwining with the gentle rustling of leaves in the breeze.

Ethan could feel the mana in the air, pulsating with life and vitality. It wrapped around him like a comforting embrace, invigorating his senses and replenishing his own well of power. It was a stark contrast to the mana-depleted environment he had encountered in the city.

Amidst this tranquil greenery, a single mountain stood tall, its majestic peak rising above the surrounding landscape. Ethan's instincts told him that this was the place where the elusive time silver bird resided. Its presence loomed like a beacon, drawing him closer with each step.

The mountain seemed untouched by the encroaching urban sprawl, standing as a testament to the enduring power of nature. Its slopes were adorned with thick vegetation and hidden trails, beckoning explorers to venture forth and discover its secrets.
