Chapter 241 Dungeon

Between mouthfuls, Mary excitedly shared her discoveries with Ethan and the others. She explained that as she devoured the creatures, their essence merged with her own, unlocking a vast array of abilities that spanned both physical and elemental realms.

The first revelation came as Mary felt a surge of energy within her, lifting her from the ground. She realized that she had acquired the power of flight, enabling her to soar through the air with grace and freedom. With a twinkle in her eyes, she described the sensation of weightlessness and the exhilaration of soaring above the world below.

Her excitement didn't end there. Mary discovered that her newfound power also enhanced her physical attributes. She could sprint with incredible speed, But perhaps the most surprising revelation was the mastery of elemental magic that Mary had acquired. With a simple gesture and a focused mind, she conjured fireballs that danced and flickered in her palms. She marveled at the warmth and power contained within her hands, harnessing the fiery energy to defend herself and aid her allies.

After the satisfying meal, the group decided to put Mary's newly acquired skills to the test. With a sense of anticipation in the air, they ventured outside, ready to witness the extent of her newfound powers.

Mary took a deep breath, feeling a surge of exhilaration course through her veins. With a swift motion of her arms, she propelled herself into the air, defying gravity and soaring with grace. She flew effortlessly, her movements fluid and controlled, as if she had been born to take flight. The wind rushed past her, lifting her higher and carrying her across the sky. With a smile of pure joy on her face, she marveled at the world below, a newfound freedom accompanying each beat of her wings.

But it was Mary's command over the fire that truly captivated their attention. With a focused gaze and a flick of her wrist, she conjured fireballs that crackled and blazed with intensity. As they soared through the air, they exploded with a force and impact akin to grenades, leaving trails of heat and light in their wake. The raw power contained within each fireball was awe-inspiring, and it served as a reminder of the formidable force Mary had become.

"To gain time, we should kill a dragon or something and make you eat it until the others return," Ethan said when they left the tavern. "The mission was supposed to last for weeks, but I want to finish things here in one week at max."

Mary couldn't help but tremble at the thought of hunting a dragon. The idea of facing such a powerful and intimidating creature filled her with fear. Dragons were incredibly scary, with their massive size and fiery breath. It was hard to imagine going up against such a formidable opponent.

The thought of standing before a dragon made Mary's heart race and her hands shake. She knew that dragons were legendary creatures known for their incredible strength and abilities. Just the image of their scaly bodies and the thought of their fiery attacks sent chills down her spine.

Mary was well aware of her own limitations. While she had gained new skills and powers, the idea of confronting a dragon was overwhelming. She felt small and insignificant compared to these majestic beasts. It seemed like an impossible task for someone like her.

"I will do the fighting, and you will just eat the dragon afterward," Ethan said while checking his shop for items that will make things that he will cook tastier, even if they have to eat it for hours."

The Blade of Flavors: This legendary knife gives you +10 Accuracy, allowing you to make flawless cuts and slices with ease. It also has a special ability called "Flavor Surge," which infuses ingredients with a burst of enhanced taste when used in a cooking motion.

I think you should take a look at

The Flavor Infuser: This artifact has the power to unlock the full potential of ingredients. With an extra thirty percent bonus in Flavor Extraction ability and food effects, it intensifies the taste and aroma of foods when activated. Use it wisely to create culinary masterpieces that tantalize the senses.

The Elemental Cauldron: This enchanted cooking pot grants you control over the elements. With adjustable temperature settings and a +20% efficiency in cooking, it reduces cooking time by 30%.

"Why the hell do I have those items?" Ethan asked and then sighed.

In any case, Ethan decided to check the memories he got and find a dragon or two. An ice dragon probably would be the best option for Mary since they should have great resilience as well, at least in theory.

Unfortunately, while Ethan found some memories of them, they were beyond the confines of that realm… taking Mary with him to the frontlines wasn't possible; it was too much bloodshed for her.

Fortunately, Ethan knew that in the extreme northern parts of the realm, he could find a dungeon of ice wolves… that world had dungeons. Still, they were different from the ones emerging on Earth. They had cores.

A dungeon with a core is like a mysterious underground maze. Deep within its passages lies a special object known as the core, which is like the heart of the dungeon. This core is usually a glowing crystal or gem that holds magical energy.

The core serves a few important purposes in the dungeon. It acts as a source of power, providing the energy needed to operate traps, mechanisms, and other magical elements within. It's like a power generator that keeps the dungeon running.

But the core does more than just supply energy. It also influences the dungeon's growth and layout. With its magic, the core can create new rooms, corridors, and even whole levels, shaping the dungeon's structure over time. It adapts to the presence of adventurers, making it a constantly changing and challenging place to explore.

Another role of the core is to control the creatures that inhabit the dungeon. It can generate copies of monsters using their essence, essentially creating more of the same type of creature.
