Chapter 278 Laughing

"Fufufuhhahahaha, I can't say how things were there since I don't recall it," Drag'drath said after laughing for a while. "It doesn't matter. I am here to make you an offer. Cut your own neck, and I will be sure not to pursue my revenge any further."

"Let me think about that for a while, and in the meantime, answer me some questions," Ethan said. "You don't deny that you died, so what is the meaning of your return?"

"We returned to claim your head, that is all," Drag'drath replied. "Just accept that obediently since you aren't as strong as before, and our forces aren't split either."

"In that case, you will have to make me understand a bit more that it is useless to resist and fight back," Ethan shrugged. "Who of what brought you all back to life?"

As Ethan locked eyes with the demon king, he couldn't help but notice the smug and arrogant smile that adorned the demon king's face. It was a smile that dripped with disdain and superiority as if the demon king regarded Ethan with contemptuous amusement.

It had been some time since Ethan had encountered such a level of arrogance directed towards him. The memory of those who had once looked down upon him, underestimating his strength and resolve, surged to the forefront of his mind. It served as a reminder of the countless battles he had fought and the adversaries he had overcome.

"I guess I will have to beat the crap out of you again to get some answers," Ethan shrugged.

"Do you think that it will change anything?" Drag'drath asked.

"Maybe not, since you died once, and it seems that you returned to fight me, so you don't value your own life at all," Ethan replied.

"Indeed, I don't. We don't fear it," Drag'drath said. "Fate and order are on our side. It doesn't matter what you try; it will be useless. We will return."

As the words of the demon king echoed through the air, Ethan couldn't help but feel a tinge of unease. The demon king's voice carried a sense of arrogance and superiority that grated against Ethan's convictions. It was as if the demon king believed himself to be beyond the confines of mortality, transcending the boundaries of life and death.

Ethan's brow furrowed as he contemplated the implications of the demon king's words. The notion that someone could attain a state of existence that surpassed the limitations of life and death seemed almost inconceivable to him. It challenged his understanding of the natural order and the balance of the world.

Ethan's gaze swept across the horde of enemies before him, his mind racing to decipher their actions and words. Despite his keen perception and analytical nature, he found himself at a loss, unable to fully comprehend the motives behind their seemingly incomprehensible behavior.

Was there a deeper purpose behind their assault on the human realm? Were they merely pawns in a larger scheme orchestrated by the demon king? Or did they harbor personal vendettas against Ethan and his companions? The questions swirled in Ethan's mind, each one leading to more uncertainty and doubt.

"I guess I will just have to turn you all into mindless puppets, I wanted to avoid that, but you are seriously pissing me off," Ethan shrugged.

Ethan's eyes widened in surprise as he watched the demon king extend his hand toward him in a gesture of apparent goodwill, offering a handshake. A mix of skepticism and caution flickered in Ethan's gaze as he hesitated for a brief moment, unsure of the demon king's true intentions.

Yet, an instinctive reaction took over Ethan's body as he swiftly slapped the demon king's hand away, refusing to engage in such an act of false camaraderie. To his astonishment, however, his powers remained dormant, failing to activate in response to the provocation. It was a perplexing realization, as his abilities had always been triggered in moments of threat or danger.

"Your strongest card is no longer useful against us," The demon king declared. "Varian, show him what you can do."

"Wasn't this kind of arrogance that made you all die in the first place?" Ethan asked.

Ethan's sigh escaped his lips, a mixture of frustration and weariness weighing heavily on his shoulders. As he took a step back, allowing some space between himself and the demon king, another figure emerged from the shadows. It was Varian, a creature of darkness and a skilled mimic.

Varian's form shifted and contorted, seamlessly transforming into an exact replica of Ethan. Every detail, from his appearance to his mannerisms, was flawlessly imitated. It was a disconcerting sight, to say the least, as Ethan found himself face-to-face with a mirror image of himself.

Varian's assault came without warning, his movements a blur of speed and precision. Ethan's instincts kicked in, and he swiftly raised his arms to shield his vulnerable head and heart from the onslaught of punches. Each strike landed with a resounding impact, jarring his body and threatening to break through his defenses.

Ethan's arms trembled under the force of Varian's relentless assault, his muscles straining to absorb the blows. The rapid succession of punches tested his endurance and resilience, pushing him to his limits. But he refused to falter, his determination fueling his resolve to withstand the barrage.

"Hehehe, this hurts like hell," Ethan thought while smirking.

Despite the intense pain and the sensation of his bones cracking with each hit, Ethan couldn't help but feel a strange sense of satisfaction. It had been a long time since he faced an opponent who could push him to his limits, someone who could truly test his strength and resolve.

With every strike that sent him flying backward, Ethan's body absorbed the impact, his muscles straining to withstand the force. The pain was excruciating, but it only fueled his determination to keep fighting. The relentless barrage of attacks from Varian served as a reminder of the power that existed beyond his curse, a reminder that he was more than just a vessel for the souls of his enemies.
