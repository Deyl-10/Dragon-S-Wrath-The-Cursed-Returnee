Chapter 207 Ancient Knowledge

"What is your goal here?" Ivan asked.

"Return home as soon as possible after benefiting myself as much as possible," Ethan replied.

"Ian didn't say that you were the type who would seek money; what do you really want?" Ivan asked.

"Do you want to buy my silence or something?" Ethan asked. "What I really want is to solve my problems and prevent others from rising, but it seems that you guys don't care about that at all. If you were certain that you could revive your wife without any issues, you wouldn't be doing this kind of work and trying to hide."

Ivan, Ian's father, observed Ethan closely as he approached. His keen eyes scrutinized every aspect of Ethan's demeanor, searching for clues to decipher the enigmatic nature of this individual who had played a significant role in his son's life.

Ethan's stoic expression and unwavering resolve intrigued Ivan. He sensed a depth within Ethan that went beyond mere physical prowess. There was an unyielding determination and resilience in his gaze, hinting at the trials and experiences he had faced.

Ivan recalled his previous encounters with Ethan, the snippets of conversation they had shared, and the actions he had witnessed. Yet, Ethan remained an enigma to him. His motives and true intentions remained obscured, and Ivan found it challenging to form a clear understanding of the kind of person he was.

Ethan's actions during the battle against the coral golem had demonstrated both fierce strength and a strategic mind. He had fought with unwavering determination and exhibited a remarkable ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Ivan couldn't help but acknowledge Ethan's resourcefulness and skill. Still, he also sensed an undercurrent of something deeper, something yet to be uncovered.

"The process is completely safe. We only came here because we would have more time to work on the final details and because the lost technology of this world would help with that as well," Ivan explained. "In one week's time on Earth, everything will be ready, and we will face the consequences of our actions."

"I am not the one calling the shots here or the ones who decided to start with this mission; you should go and talk with them," Ethan said. "Everyone knows that what you are trying to pull off is way too dangerous. It isn't knowledge that you can find in the planets that we have contact with. If you succeed, a lot of enemies will do whatever it takes to get the knowledge; if you fail, the possibility of the shit hitting the fan is extremely high.

Ivan understood the risks and potential consequences involved in his plan to revive his wife from the afterlife. He was well aware that meddling with the realm beyond death was an inherently perilous endeavor, fraught with uncertainties and unforeseen outcomes. While his desire to reunite with his beloved wife was strong, he couldn't ignore the looming shadow of the unknown that loomed over such a risky undertaking.

One of the primary concerns was the potential for attracting the attention of dark and malevolent forces. The act of tampering with the boundaries between life and death could inadvertently invite the presence of sinister entities or unleash ancient and powerful curses. These forces, driven by their own agendas and desires, might seek to exploit the breach and wreak havoc upon the world.

Moreover, there was the possibility that Ivan's actions could disturb the delicate balance of the afterlife itself. Pulling a spirit back from its rightful place and attempting to force it into the realm of the living could result in a ripple effect that disrupts the natural order of things. This disturbance could lead to unforeseen consequences, causing chaos, unrest, and a disturbance in the spiritual fabric of both worlds.

Ivan was keenly aware that he couldn't control what might emerge from the depths of the afterlife. There was a lurking danger, an ominous presence that could manifest alongside his wife's spirit or even take her place entirely. It was a gamble he was willing to take, driven by love and desperation. Still, he understood the inherent risk and the potential for dire consequences.

"In the first place, where did you get the knowledge to do that?" Ethan asked. "Did you make some experiments before to test the formula?"

"We can't produce more than one dosage of the potion, so we can't test it," Ivan explained. "The potion isn't something that can revive peopleâ€¦ it can revert time based on the dosage and the object where it is used in it."

As Ethan pondered the concept of the time reversal potion, he grasped the basic idea behind it. The body needed to be preserved in a frozen state to bring someone back from the afterlife. Then, with the infusion of a powerful magical potion, time could be reversed, allowing the body to go back in time and retrieve the departed spirit.

Ethan understood that the potion's effectiveness relied on a significant amount of magical energy. Magic was intricately connected to the spirit and soul, known as mana. By harnessing this mana, the potion could manipulate the fundamental forces of time and reverse its flow.

The interaction between the time-reversal potion and the cryogenically preserved body was a complex process. The potion's infusion, guided by skilled practitioners, triggered a reversal of the body's physiological processes. Cells rejuvenated, damaged tissues healed, and most importantly, the lost spirit was retrieved.

Ethan recognized that creating such a potion required advanced knowledge, rare ingredients, and exceptional magical skill. While he couldn't fathom the exact materials and techniques involved, he grasped the fundamental principles behind the potion's workings.

"That is very interesting and all, but you still didn't explain how you got the formulae," Ethan said.

"We gathered the knowledge of all words, and Anna did the rest; with her powers and knowledge, she can make potions that can do anything," Ivan said. "She was blessed and has the access of an ancient overlord of alchemy."
