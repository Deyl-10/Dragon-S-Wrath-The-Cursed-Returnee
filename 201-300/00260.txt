Chapter 260 Ready, Set, Go

Earthen Armor: increases your endurance by ten points per level at the cost of one hundred points of mana per second.

Ethan sighed in relief when he managed to pull that off. It is amazing what humans can do when they are cornered… he used all of his focus to keep the forgotten voices in his head away and used the same to train his magic.

"Now I just need to learn how to make water and fire armor and then combine all of them," Ethan thought. "That should be good training to control my magic and my curse."

As Ethan thought about how he could expedite his mastery of the other elemental armors, he noticed Luneria teaching Emily the basics of time magic. He saw Emily concentrating as Luneria explained how to use pure mana to manipulate the laws of physics. Emily's initial goal was to create a mana barrier around her head to enhance her thinking speed.

Ethan recognized the potential benefits of time magic, not just for Emily but for the entire group. The ability to control time could be incredibly valuable in their battles and strategic planning. However, he also realized that learning such complex magic would require a significant investment of time and effort.

Considering their current mission and the pressing threats they faced, Ethan grappled with the decision of whether to devote more time to mastering new abilities. While he saw the allure of unlocking the potential of time magic, he couldn't ignore the urgency of their situation.

In the end, Ethan concluded that they needed to strike a balance between personal growth and their immediate objectives. While Emily explored time magic, he resolved to focus on refining his existing skills and seeking out opportunities for growth along their journey.

Ethan understood the importance of staying focused on their mission and not getting too caught up in individual pursuits. They had limited time and resources, and their ultimate goal was to protect their world and restore peace.

Before long, night came, and then Ethan's parents arrived. Emily said goodbye and then sent a message to Hannah to send her home, but she didn't respond.

"I guess she is busy…" Emily said.

"No way, she was Infected by Ian's stupidity… it is a terrible virus that makes one lose brain cells and do stupid things," Ethan said while facepalming.

"... What are we going to do?" Emily asked.

Ethan contemplated the challenge of explaining Emily's presence in his room while his parents were away. Her sudden appearance could clearly raise suspicions, especially given their complex situation and the need for secrecy.

He understood that it would be challenging to come up with a convincing explanation for Emily's presence, considering she was essentially a stranger to his world. The risk of raising unnecessary questions or drawing unwanted attention was something they had to be cautious about.

Ultimately, Ethan realized that it was best to handle the situation with transparency and honesty. He would have a conversation with his parents, explaining the circumstances surrounding Emily's presence and the reasons behind it. While it might be challenging for them to comprehend the full extent of their journey and the existence of other worlds, he hoped they would trust his judgment and support his decisions.

"We will have to tell the truth, my parents are understanding, and they won't judge you too much when I tell them that a horny girl appeared in my room out of nowhere," Ethan said.

"You wouldn't…" Emily furrowed her eyebrows.

"I guess you don't know me well enough," Ethan shrugged.

Thanks to that situation, Ethan felt like he could finally forget his problems a bit. In any case, instead of letting trouble brew by letting a misunderstanding happen, he explained to his parents what happened, and Emily ended up having dinner with them. Fortunately, Michael and Evelyn didn't like to waste with nonsensical assumptions like Hannah, so they only talked about not troublesome issues.

"No answer from your sister… I guess the timing today is really bad," Emily said and then sighed once they finished dinner.

"I can't see anything on the news aside from what we heard," Ethan said while checking his cell phone. "Anyway, you can go to Hannah's room until she responds. You can go with her, Luneria. I won't be able to focus if you two keep making noise in my room."

"Okay, I will inform my Dad as well about this," Emily said. "He isn't at home, but he will feel better knowing where I am."

Emily's father being occupied due to the dungeons was yet another complication that added to the challenges they faced. As a doctor, he was likely called upon to assist with the increased number of injured individuals resulting from the dungeon incidents.

Ethan understood that the dungeons had far-reaching consequences, affecting not only their immediate group but also the lives of the people around them. The widespread impact of these events meant that many individuals, like Emily's father, were dedicating their time and efforts to help those affected.

Ethan resumed his training, and this time, he decided to combine Mana Force with Frozen Enchantment. He couldn't use Fire Enchantment at home for obvious reasons. Still, soon he was forced to stop with that as well since he was dropping the temperature in the room and making his bet getting damped.

"... I guess training at school or somewhere is a better option now," Ethan thought after a long sigh.

Ethan's instincts, honed through countless battles and experiences, were powerful forces that guided him even in times of rest. Though he longed for a moment of respite and relaxation, a nagging sense of urgency compelled him to remain vigilant and ready for whatever challenges lay ahead.

His instincts, finely tuned to detect danger and perceive shifts in the balance of power, alerted him to the fact that the current situation demanded his attention. It was as if an invisible thread connected him to the unfolding events, urging him to stay engaged and prepared.
