Chapter 267 Back From The Beyond

Ethan's thoughts turned to the possibility of spies infiltrating their ranks, gathering intelligence, and setting up these rifts strategically. The realization sent a shiver down his spine, he knew very well that things shouldn't be like that.

"This has been too easy so far… strangely easy," Ethan thought while he was closing in on the rift. "Something smells fishy here."

Ethan stood still for a moment, his senses heightened as he scanned his surroundings, searching for any signs of the elusive enemy. He strained his ears, listening for the faintest of sounds, and concentrated his gaze, scouring every nook and cranny for any hints of movement. Yet, despite his best efforts, he found no trace of the unseen observers.

A sense of frustration and unease gnawed at Ethan's mind. He knew that their adversaries possessed formidable resources and allies, making it difficult to pinpoint their exact location. They seemed to have eyes and ears everywhere, lurking in the shadows, gathering information, and planning their next move.

Ethan clenched his fists, determined not to let this setback deter him. He understood that their fight was not only physical but also a battle of wits and strategy. They had to outsmart their enemies, uncover their hidden networks, and strike at their vulnerabilities.

Ethan ignored the suspicious gazes of the onlookers as he made his way back to where Anna was. He understood their disbelief and questioning stares. After all, his exceptional strength and skills were far beyond what one would expect from a person his age.

He approached Anna, who greeted him with a smile that betrayed her concern. She knew that Ethan possessed extraordinary abilities, and she had witnessed his incredible feats firsthand.

"I felt the presence of someone watching me before; keep your guard up," Ethan said. "The enemies failed in making the summoned heroes go to other worlds using the dungeons, so I am guessing that they are doing this to make us reveal ourselves and split our numbers."

"I suppose that makes sense, but I have some cards up my sleeve," Anna said.

Divide and conquer is a widely used tactic in warfare due to its effectiveness in overcoming larger or stronger adversaries. The strategy involves breaking down a larger force into smaller, more manageable factions and then dealing with them individually. By dividing the enemy's attention, resources, and forces, one can gain a strategic advantage and increase the chances of victory.

By dividing the enemy's forces, their overall strength is significantly reduced. It becomes easier to overwhelm and defeat smaller groups rather than face the full might of a united enemy.

Dividing the enemy allows for the identification and exploitation of weaknesses within their ranks. Different factions may have distinct weaknesses, such as poor coordination, differing ideologies, or conflicting leadership. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to strategic advantages and increased chances of success.

Divided forces often struggle with communication and coordination, especially if their leaders are disconnected, or their objectives differ. This lack of unity can result in confusion, slower decision-making, and decreased effectiveness on the battlefield.

Dividing the enemy can create a sense of isolation, uncertainty, and demoralization among their ranks. It undermines their unity, fosters internal strife, and diminishes morale, making it easier to defeat them both physically and psychologically.

Ethan knew that more than a little bit well, so he wasn't surprised to see that in action. Still, the scale of the situation was just insane since it seemed that many words were trying to invade Earth.

After not so long, Ethan was teleported again, and this time, he found himself in Orlando.

Once known for its light-hearted atmosphere and vibrant charm, Orlando now lies in ruins. The echoes of explosions and the cries of desperation reverberated through the air, a stark contrast to the usual joyous sounds that once filled the city. The monsters had swept through the streets with alarming speed, leaving destruction and chaos in their wake.

Ethan stood amidst the wreckage, his heart heavy with the realization of how quickly everything had changed. The once bustling streets were now littered with debris, buildings reduced to crumbling ruins, and the air thick with the stench of smoke and fear. The vibrant colors that once adorned the city had faded, replaced by a somber darkness that hung heavily over the landscape.

"Sorry for making you come here," Emily's voice suddenly echoed from behind.

Ethan turned around and then saw Emily resting in an alley with a serious wound on her stomach. That she was unable to heal it for some reason.

"What happened here? Why can't you heal yourself?" Ethan asked while he tried to use Heal.

"I was caught off guard… I recognized those monsters, they are basically the same ones that I defeated in that world," Emily said while she was breathing roughly. "That wasn't supposed to be possible, but I ignored that and decided to fight, but then something or someone attacked me from behind… now I have been poisoned by something that makes me waste mana and nullifies the effects of healing as well."

Ethan's mind buzzed with confusion as he tried to reconcile the presence of the monsters from the world that Emily had saved. It didn't make sense. If that world had been rescued, then how could these creatures have found their way into Orlando? The logical explanation eluded him, adding to the weight of the already dire situation.

As Ethan tended to Emily's injuries, his mind briefly shifted from the perplexing situation to the task at hand. He carefully retrieved one of the elixirs he had acquired during a previous mission and administered it to Emily. The potent concoction flowed through her system, countering the effects of the poison and hastening the healing process.

Ethan's attention was solely on Emily as he observed the elixir's remarkable effects. He marveled at how it worked, closing the wound and restoring her vitality. It was a testament to the power of ancient remedies and the knowledge passed down through generations.
