Chapter 232 Going Solo

The enemies planned to unleash these corrupted heroes, armed with their unique powers and knowledge of Earth, as formidable weapons to wreak havoc upon their homeland.

A heavy silence descended upon the group as they grappled with the weight of this revelation. The realization that their former allies had become enemies only fueled their determination to protect Earth. They understood the need to confront not only the enemies lurking within the dungeons but also those who had turned against them.

"I was planning to have some lessons today, but I should inform my father and some others that can do something about it," Dante declared. "See you later."

Dante left, and Aline followed him. They truly looked like love birds like that. Ethan wanted to joke around about that, but it would be hard to do so since Emily was nearby.

"Go on, say it," Emily said.

"I knew it," Ethan shrugged. "Anyway, things are going to become quite tense from now on, and we should prepare. You should prepare since I won't be around all the time to cover for you."

"How condescending," Emily said. "Not like I am not used to you acting like that."

"Anyway, I learned a new skill while I was… while you guys were traveling around that world in search of the One Piece," Ethan corrected himself. "It would benefit you to learn it."

Ethan and Emily entered the simulator room, a space dedicated to training and enhancing their abilities. With a determined expression, Ethan showcased his mastery over the Lightning Armor spell to Emily.

As Ethan focused his concentration, a surge of mana enveloped him, forming an ethereal armor made of crackling lightning. The arcing bolts of electricity danced across his body, creating a mesmerizing display of raw power. The air around him crackled with energy, and a faint glow emanated from the armor.

Ethan demonstrated the versatility of the Lightning Armor. He swiftly moved, the armor enhancing his speed and reflexes, allowing him to dodge simulated attacks effortlessly. The crackling lightning surrounding him served as both a defensive barrier and a formidable weapon.

Emily couldn't help but feel a mix of admiration and excitement as she witnessed the Lightning Armor's capabilities. She recognized the potential it held, both in terms of protection and offensive prowess. It was a testament to Ethan's skill and dedication to mastering his magical abilities.

"If you master this, you will have a free getaway ticket from most sticky situations," Ethan said.

"How did you learn that in a couple of hours?" Emily asked, still surprised.

I think you should take a look at

"This is five percent luck. Fifteen percent skill. Sixty percent concentrated power of will. "Ethan said. "Ten percent pleasure. Thirty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name. Not that the math makes sense."

While Emily had expertise in Electrical Enchantment, allowing her to manipulate electricity and create such effects, and she had a good grasp of using Mana Force to amplify her spells, she hadn't yet mastered the fusion of these two abilities required to manifest the Lightning Armor. It was a complex technique that would require time and dedicated practice to achieve.

Emily acknowledged that she still had much to learn and improve upon. She accepted that her current abilities had their own strengths and applications. Still, she was eager to expand her repertoire and unlock the potential of the Lightning Armor spell. She saw it as a symbol of her growth and a goal to strive for in her journey.

As Ethan watched Emily diligently practicing the Lightning Armor spell, he couldn't help but feel a sense of curiosity. Inspired by her dedication, he decided to embark on his own experimentations with different elemental armor spells. However, his efforts on that particular day didn't yield any significant progress.

Undeterred by the initial setback, Ethan knew that mastering these spells would require time and patience. When he returned home, he decided to do some brainstorming to be able to make progress in that field, but then he received a message from Dante… it couldn't be a good thing.

'The higher-ups came with a plan to get some more intel and to capture some enemies. They made me the leader of the team, and they want me to call some people that I can trust. Do you want to join the expedition?'

The message caught him off guard, and he couldn't help but feel surprised by what he read. Dante had outlined a plan for a swift and coordinated attack against the enemies, suggesting that some people were already moving with great speed to gather resources and allies.

The idea of delivering a powerful blow to the enemies intrigued Ethan, stirring a mix of excitement and hesitation within him. He liked the thought of making a significant impact and turning the tide of the battle. However, at the same time, he didn't particularly enjoy the idea of being bossed around or having his actions dictated by others.

Ethan valued his independence and preferred to make decisions based on his own judgment. He didn't want to feel confined to a predefined role or lose control over his actions. The thought of being part of a tightly organized group and following orders made him pause and reconsider.

'If the mission is a success, they are planning to create a special squad for this kind of special mission, we will be relieved front the duties at school, and we will be promoted as well.'

It seemed that Dante was reading Ethan's thoughts and trying to convince him. Not having to go to school every day was appealing, but the demerits still surpassed the merits. Ethan had to find another solution to that issue. Ethan decided to call Dante to say what he had decided, and in the end, he accepted the call.

"I can help you in exchange for being free from the school," Ethan said. "Things are going to get serious now, and I won't have time to go there. I need to work on my own plans, and I can't tie myself to any organization."
