Chapter 274 Again

As the chaos of the outside world continued to unfold, Ethan found solace in the familiar practice of meditation. With a focused mind and a deep connection to his mana, he delved into the depths of his inner strength. Instead of seeking rest, he channeled his energy into refining his skills, honing his abilities, and expanding his repertoire of elemental armors.

Ethan tapped into the essence of frost in the serene quiet of his meditation. He visualized the icy winds, the crystalline structures, and the cold grip of winter. With each breath, he drew upon his mana, shaping it into a new form, a new armor that would shield him in the battle to come.

As he delved deeper into the meditation, the room around him seemed to grow colder. Frost formed on the surface of objects, and a faint mist hung in the air. Ethan's body became the conduit for the manifestation of his will as his mana took on the properties of cold.

You learned the skill Frost Armor.

Frost Armor: Increases your resistance and physic by ten points per level at the cost of one hundred points of mana per second.

The Frost Armor envelops Ethan in a shimmering layer of icy blue, with delicate patterns of frost decorating its surface. The armor not only provides physical protection, but it also emits an aura of chill that can slow down the movements of his enemies and repel heat-based attacks.

The armor's icy nature allows it to absorb and disperse incoming energy, reducing the impact of blows and shielding Ethan from harm. It also enhances his resilience, enabling him to endure extreme temperatures and resist the effects of frostbite.

The Frost Armor serves as a symbol of Ethan's mastery over the power of frost and his ability to harness elemental forces in combat. It represents his adaptability and versatility, granting him an additional layer of defense to face the challenges that lie ahead.

"What did I say about training elemental magic?" Emily asked.

"It is fine; after this, I just need to complete one more step," Ethan said. "Besides, I was lucky. If I hadn't started this before, I wouldn't have any chance against Drag'drath now."

"I am amazed that you managed to defeat a guy that can destroy areas the size of entire states," Emily said.

"Well, he is stupid." Ethan shrugged. "Just like all the bosses of video games, he power-leveled me by sending his minions after me. His four generals tried with their minions, and then they came; I kicked their asses."

Ethan recalled them after a long while. Zalgor, the Blighted Necromancer. Zalgor is a master of dark magic and necromancy. He commands legions of undead creatures, raising them from the dead and imbuing them with unholy powers. With his skeletal visage and tattered robes, Zalgor instills fear and decay wherever he goes.

Kana, the Enchantress of Seduction. Kanais is a seductive and alluring succubus who possesses enchanting beauty and irresistible charm. She uses her powers of manipulation and seduction to deceive and corrupt those who cross her path, often leading them to their demise.

Varian, the Shapeshifting Phantom. Varian is a cunning doppelganger who can seamlessly assume the appearance of anyone he desires. His ability to mimic voices and personalities makes him a formidable infiltrator and spy. Varian's true form is an elusive mystery, as he constantly changes his appearance to blend into the shadows.

Sirus, the Deathbound Knight. Sirus is a fearsome warrior who wields a massive dark sword and is clad in black armor adorned with intricate designs of skulls and bones. As a death knight, Sirus possesses unholy powers and is virtually indestructible. He commands an army of undead soldiers and strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies.

"By the way, are the voices bothering you now?" Emily asked.

"... If I stay focused doing something else, they won't bother me," Ethan replied, already imagining where Emily was trying to go with that.

"So, only when you are alone and when you aren't focused on training, that is when the voices bother you?" Emily asked.

"What voices?" Hannah asked. "You would better not be hiding anything from me... spill the beans."

Ethan and Emily froze in surprise as Hannah suddenly appeared before them. Her sudden appearance indicated that she had overheard their conversation, and both of them exchanged glances, wondering how much she had heard. Hannah's eyes held a mix of concern and determination as if she had something important to say.

"It is the voice of my heart that tells me to become a hero in shining armor that will lead the other heroes to the path of righteousness," Ethan replied. "Listen to your heart...when he's calling for you."

"... We will talk about that when you return…" Hannah said. "Follow Dante's commands again. I will send reinforcements soon enough."

With a wave of her hand, Hannah activated her teleportation magic, instantly transporting the group to a remote and mountainous area in the extreme south of South America. As they materialized, Ethan and the others found themselves surrounded by towering peaks and a vast expanse of snow-covered landscape. The air was frigid, and the sky above was shrouded in a blanket of gray clouds, hinting at the imminent snowfall.

The mountains stretched as far as the eye could see, their majestic peaks reaching up to touch the heavens. Snow-capped cliffs and rugged terrain painted a picture of untamed beauty and formidable grandeur. The silence of the surroundings was broken only by the soft whisper of the wind, carrying the promise of imminent snowfall.

"What a desolate place… at least we won't have to worry about the enemies destroying our civilization here," Emily said.

"That also means that the enemies will have the chance to keep coming through the rifts without being bothered here," Ethan said. "In my final push, the demon king had five million on his side, and they were all at least on the D rank when it comes to heroes."
