Chapter 288 Red Flag

"It has been a while… I have forgotten this kind of feeling," Ethan said. "In any case, your hands sure are soft, warm, and frail looking… You have some very girly fingers."

"It must be because I am a girl…" Emily said while she pulled away her hands. "Now we are even. You helped me a bunch, and now I helped you the same way."

"No way," Ethan said.

Emily had always known Ethan to be a kind and caring person, so this unexpected display of greed left her feeling disheartened.

For a moment, Emily couldn't help but question the person she thought she knew. She wondered if Ethan's actions were driven by a desire for power or if he had succumbed to the darker side of his curse. The disappointment weighed heavy on her as she had hoped for a deeper connection based on trust and understanding.

"We can say for sure that I owe you a lot more," Ethan said. "With your help, I probably saved several day's worth of trial and error."

"Days, huh… I guess your ego is part of you, after all," Emily shrugged.

"I will repay the favor once this is over," Ethan said. "How about one date?"

"Yeah, no thanks," Emily replied.

"Just for starters, you can ask for more; you don't need to feel bashful over it," Ethan said. "You can decide this later. For now, give me your hand again."

"As long as you don't say or do anything weird…" Emily said.

As Ethan touched Emily's hand, a surge of determination coursed through him. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and focused his senses on his inner power. With a newfound clarity, he attempted to reverse the flow of his ability to give rather than take.

Concentrating on the connection between them, Ethan visualized a gentle transfer of mana from himself to Emily. He envisioned his own mana flowing through his hand and into hers, replenishing what he had inadvertently drained from her moments ago. With each breath, he willed his power to change, to become an act of generosity and support.

Slowly, he felt a subtle shift within him. The energy that once sought to consume now transformed into a gift, a selfless offering. A faint glow emanated from his hand as if his mana recognized his intent and responded in kind.

"It seems that you have finally understood the essence of your power," Luneria suddenly appeared and then said. "It is called Absolute Memory."

In a magical context, "Absolute Memory" refers to a supernatural ability or power that allows someone to obtain and manipulate memories in an extraordinary manner. It grants the individual the capacity to access and control memories with precision and completeness, transcending the limitations of normal human memory.

This process involves directly extracting memories from a person's mind or consciousness, usually through magical absorption. With Absolute Memory, one can create vivid imprints of their own memories or the memories of others. This ability allows them to transfer these imprints onto objects, individuals, or even within their own minds, effectively sharing the experiences contained within the memories.

This ability enables the magic-user to read and comprehend the memories of others without altering or affecting them. By focusing their magical energies or employing specific rituals, they can tap into someone's mind and perceive their past experiences, thoughts, and emotions with insane speed and precision.

"How did you know that?" Ethan asked. "Why didn't you tell me that earlier?"

"I have been alive for a while, so I know a lot," Luneria explained. "Regardless, you must have a good memory from birth, and that is why you were chosen to be the host of a similar power. From what I know, Hedo has a history of three billion years. Thousands of societies emerged and disappeared in that world, and that is the reason why your system has so many things and can do so much as well. As to why I didn't reveal everything until now, it is because your power can be stolen. You should know now after using it to empower Emily."

Ethan, being aware of the potential consequences of returning to level one and losing his power, understood the risks involved. However, his understanding of the power and its capabilities also made him a target for enemies who sought to exploit this knowledge and find a way to force him into that vulnerable state.

As Ethan continued to use his power, his actions and abilities would likely draw attention from observant enemies. By closely observing his behavior, adversaries could discern patterns and deduce the nature of his powers. This understanding would enable them to strategize and devise plans specifically aimed at compelling Ethan to revert to level one.

"I guess I really needed to grow up…" Ethan said.

Before long, Emily opened her eyes, and she felt a bit dizzy since Ethan passed to her the magic knowledge of useless skills for him. She got a lot stronger thanks to it.

"... This was a weird experience," Emily said while looking at her hands.

"Why are you looking at your hands? Only your magic got stronger," Ethan said. "Anyway, with my help, you can probably surpass Aline."

"I am fine getting a power-up for the sake of the mission, but not to defeat her," Emily said while studying Ethan.

Emily couldn't help but feel a sense of suspicion towards Ethan's sudden change in behavior. He had always been guarded and reserved, rarely showing kindness or openly expressing his emotions. However, recently, he had become unexpectedly nice and considerate, which raised a few red flags in Emily's mind.

She was the type to think too much about certain things, so it couldn't be helped that she was worried about that. Still, it was hard to imagine that he had ill intentions. So, she focused on the next step.
