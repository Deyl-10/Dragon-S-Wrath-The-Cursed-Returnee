Chapter 238 Investiment

"I can sense weird in the air, but I can't say that magic smells anything to me," Ethan said.

"You had the aura of someone who fought demons for months, and you never developed a sense to profane magic?" Ian asked.

Ethan's knowledge of profane magic had been acquired through his experiences and encounters in the worlds he had traversed. While he wasn't an expert, he held a firm belief in his understanding of its nature. In the world he had previously saved, profane magic was a dark and forbidden practice that delved into the manipulation and consumption of souls.

The practitioners of profane magic would harness the essence of departed souls, drawing upon their residual energy to fuel their spells and rituals. It was a gruesome and macabre form of magic that bordered on sacrilege, as it exploited the sacred bond between life and death.

Ethan had witnessed firsthand the consequences of profane magic. It left a trail of devastation and despair in its wake, as the souls of the departed were used as mere fuel for the ambitions of the living. The ethical implications weighed heavily on his conscience, as he understood the inherent wrongness of tampering with the afterlife.

"I fought against some enemies like that. They were a pain since they could heal using souls and attack using souls… they could also negate damage using souls," Ethan said while shrugging.

Ian began to analyze the area with his watch, and he confirmed that souls had been used as fuel to perform some teleportation spells there. Ethan felt like sighing… profane mages were especially hard to deal with since the more souls they had, the stronger and tougher they were… countering that was only possible with holy magic, and Ethan didn't know any.

In any case, Ian finished his job after half an hour, and then they dashed back toward the castle.

Ethan understood that they couldn't just abandon the world and let the forces of darkness prevail. They had to act quickly and deal with those who had chosen to follow the path of evil. It was a daunting task, but they had to face it head-on.

Ethan understood the need for urgency. They had to act swiftly and decisively, eliminating those who had aligned themselves with the dark forces. Time was of the essence, as the enemies' ranks were likely growing by the day, bolstered by the allure of power and promises of victory.

"Say no to unlimited power. Welcome to the light side of the force. We have cookies," Ethan thought.

When Ethan and Ian returned to the castle, they noticed that no one in the city had realized what was going on yet, or they didn't care in one way or the other. That was a bit concerning since it made Ethan feel like he and his friends would have to do all the work. Regardless, Ian and Emily began to work on transferring the data to Hannah.

"Good work," Dante said. "While you were away, we learned what Mary can do. Honestly, I was expecting something more generic, but it can help us a lot either way."

I think you should take a look at

"Time is something that we can't waste, so you can go straight to the point," Ethan said.

"Well, she doesn't like it very much, so I don't want to say it out loud," Dante said and then approached to whisper. "She has an ability called Devourer. She basically can use the abilities of the enemies that she eats freely."

The group listened attentively as Dante explained the unique ability possessed by Mary, known as the Devourer. Dante described how this power granted Mary the extraordinary capability to freely use any power or spell associated with the monsters she devoured. However, he also acknowledged the unsettling nature of this ability, particularly for a young girl like Mary.

Dante emphasized that for Mary to tap into the abilities of a specific monster, she would need to consume it. This required her to eat the flesh or absorb the mana of the monster possessing the desired ability. While the Devourer offered immense flexibility and potential, it came with the unconventional and unappetizing requirement of consuming monsters.

As Dante continued, he further explained an intriguing aspect of the Devourer. The more Mary consumed monsters of the same type, the stronger the associated ability would become. Each subsequent devouring would enhance and refine her mastery over that particular power or spell. It was a gradual process of growth and adaptation, enabling her to harness the full potential of the abilities she acquired.

Yet, Ethan understood the apprehension Mary might feel towards this power. Eating monsters was not a task that aligned with a young girl's preferences or comfort zone. It presented a moral dilemma and a psychological burden that Ethan and the others would need to address sensitively and supportively.

It was a powerful trait, but not many would like to have it or would be able to develop it further. Still, that was a problem easily solved. They just had to make Mary eat things that didn't look gross and from monsters that she didn't feel repulsed by it… if all else fails, they could always hide that from her.

"Before making my decision, I want to hear your opinions on the matter," Dante said. "Should we fight for this world or not?"

"I think that we should since if the enemy can use profane magic, then leaving a world full of souls for them will be stupid," Aline said.

"This place is also a place where Mary was supposed to improve her powers, and she can't do that on Earth so easily," Emily added. "I vote for yes too."

The group came up with a plan to bring Mary monster food from other worlds to Earth to help strengthen her powers, even if they were eventually forced to return to their own world. They considered it a worthwhile investment and were determined to support Mary's growth, no matter the cost.
