Chapter 296 Final Battle (8)

That was the Omni Armor, the strongest support spell that Ethan had envisioned a while ago. It encompassed all the effects of Fire Armor, Lightning Armor, Earthen Armor, and Frost Armor.

"Kill him!" The demon king shouted once he realized that Ethan had become as dangerous as the time he killed him.

All the enemies jumped toward Ethan and the others, and an oppressive atmosphere settled over the battlefield. The air became heavy with an aura of malevolence and foreboding. Dozens of enemies, each bearing the same level of power as the fearsome demon king, charged forward with relentless determination.

The ground trembled beneath their feet as these formidable adversaries closed in on the group. Their presence alone seemed to distort the very fabric of reality, casting a shadow of darkness that engulfed the battlefield. Each enemy exuded an overwhelming aura of power, their expressions twisted with malice and a thirst for destruction.

A heavy silence was broken only by the sounds of approaching footsteps and the clashing of weapons. Amongst the group, Ethan remained motionless, his gaze fixed upon the encroaching horde.

His stillness seemed to defy the chaos unfolding around him, a calmness in the face of imminent danger. His allies, though filled with anticipation, felt a surge of confidence in his unwavering presence. They knew that something extraordinary was about to unfold.

In a sudden and unexpected turn of events, Ethan vanished from sight, disappearing from the battlefield in the blink of an eye. As the enemies closed in on his position, they were met with an invisible force, like an impenetrable wall surrounding Ethan's friends.

Confusion rippled through the enemy ranks as they found themselves repelled, unable to breach the invisible barrier that shielded the group. Their attacks were deflected, their strikes rendered impotent against the unseen resistance.

Everyone noticed that Ethan disappeared, but only for a second. They could tell that he did something, but they didn't know why… as for the enemies, they were pushed away, and their faces began to get swollen.

"Attack them freely," Ethan said.

A moment of hesitation gripped Emily, Aline, Dante, Ian, Mary, and Anna. The sudden turn of events left them momentarily stunned, unsure of how to proceed.

However, a fire ignited within their hearts in the face of the encroaching threat. Determination surged through their veins, overpowering their initial hesitation. They recognized the opportunity that had presented itself—a chance to strike back at the immobilized enemies.

With a shared resolve, Emily, Aline, Dante, Ian, Mary, and Anna unleashed a torrent of attacks upon the motionless adversaries. Each of them tapped into their unique abilities. Everyone had received the rings that use mana potions for them from Ian and Anna, so they didn't hesitate in going all out.

Emily and Aline used their magical talents, harnessing the power of ice and nature in perfect harmony. With synchronized precision, they unleashed a chilling blast that enveloped a group of enemies, encasing them in a thick layer of ice. The frozen foes became trapped, and their movements halted in an icy prison.

Seizing the opportunity, Dante sprang into action. He expertly sliced through the frozen enemies with his sword, cleaving them into numerous pieces. Each strike was executed with impeccable accuracy, his blade moving like a whirlwind as he dismantled the immobilized adversaries.

Meanwhile, Anna, drawing upon the magical energies stored within her potions, summoned a contingent of sturdy golems to cover their flank. The golems stood tall and formidable, their rocky exteriors offering an impenetrable defense against the encroaching enemies.

On the other side, Mary tapped into her innate power, channeling it through her breath. She unleashed a mighty Frost Breath that swept across the battlefield, freezing the ground beneath the enemies' feet and creating a barrier of ice. The chilling frost kept the enemies at bay, inhibiting their movements and forcing them to navigate through treacherous terrain.

Ethan wasn't doing anything, even though his Omni Armor was active… There was a reason for that, though. As for Ian, he kept an eye on the demon king, who was looking for a chance to use large-scale spells, but thanks to Ian, that wasn't possible…

It didn't take long for some of the enemies to fall. The temperature around had dropped so much that when the group was feeling cold… Dante's sword slashes were so powerful as well that the sound of metal cutting the air was audible.

"Why aren't you fighting?" The three hooded figures asked. "What are you plotting?"

"Who knows?" Ethan asked while shrugging.

Ethan felt like he was expecting too much from the agents of chaos… anyone with half of a brain and some time would be able to see what he was plotting. Regardless, some enemies began to fall dead, but soon they returned to life.

As the battle raged on, the enemies displayed their resilience and refused to yield. Revived and imbued with newfound strength, they launched wave after wave of relentless attacks against Ethan and his comrades. However, the group remained steadfast, their focus unwavering amidst the chaos unfolding around them.

They fought with a tenacity born from the knowledge that failure was not an option. No matter how strong or numerous the enemies became, Ethan and his companions met them head-on, their spirits unbroken. However, there was another reason for that…

"They are getting stronger!" The demon king shouted. "They are using this chance to get stronger with their weird power, and they also are hoping to make chaos lose energy by keeping reviving us."

"I see, that makes sense," The three cloaked figures said.

A collective clicking of tongues resonated among Ethan and his companions. Though they had gained some levels and experienced growth in their abilities, they yearned for more, hungry to reach new heights and unlock their untapped potential. It was the only thing they could do to solve that messy situation.
