Chapter 230 Chat

"I can tell that you are worried about the well-being of your parents, given that you granted a magic item to your dog," Luneria said. "I can stay here and watch over them. As long as they don't move too far away, I can feel their presence as well, and I will be able to help them in case something happens. As for what I want to eat, everything that has mana will do fine."

As Ethan pondered the potential of Luneria's mana recovery, a realization struck him like a bolt of lightning. Despite losing her powers, Luneria had the ability to replenish her mana by absorbing more of it. It appeared that she didn't have a maximum capacity for storing mana; instead, she could continue to gather and harness its energy.

In the end, Ethan brought a bunch of potions from his inventory and gave it to her. Instead of sleeping, he realized that she was in a constant state of meditation to recover her powers. She naturally could use Mana Force, and that was quite annoying since Ethan had to work for weeks to learn it.

As Ethan walked into the dining area, the aroma of freshly prepared breakfast filled the air. His family turned their heads in surprise, not expecting him to return so soon after being informed of his mission by Hannah. Their eyes widened with curiosity, eager to hear the details of his adventure.

Ethan greeted his family with a warm smile, taking a seat at the table. As he contemplated his next move, his thoughts were consumed by the newfound potential of Luneria's mana recovery. He realized that her restored powers could be instrumental in ensuring the safety and well-being of his loved ones.

With each bite of his meal, Ethan's mind churned with ideas on how to harness Luneria's abilities to protect his family. He recognized that her unlimited mana absorption could serve as a powerful defense against any threat that might come their way. He knew that he needed to find a way to support and guide her in unlocking the full potential of her powers.

After the meal, Ethan headed to the school. As Ethan walked through the familiar halls of his school, a strange sense of emptiness washed over him. The bustling chatter and laughter that usually filled the corridors were noticeably absent. A lot of the kids didn't go to the school that day.

Ethan glanced around, searching for the familiar faces of his acquaintances, but they were nowhere to be found. It was an odd feeling like a piece of the puzzle was missing. He wondered where they could be, why they were absent on this particular day.

As he made his way to his first class, Ethan took a seat at an empty desk, feeling a sense of isolation in the sea of unfamiliar faces. The usual banter and laughter that filled the classroom were absent, replaced by a subdued silence. He missed the camaraderie and connection he shared with his acquaintances, their conversations, and shared experiences.

Throughout the day, Ethan moved from one class to another, observing the sparse attendance of students. The hallways echoed with his footsteps, and the empty seats around him served as a constant reminder of the absence of his usual companions. It was a stark contrast to the lively and vibrant atmosphere he was accustomed to.

"What a bunch of lazybones," Ethan thought.

Ethan couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness and boredom without the presence of his usual acquaintances. Though he tried to convince himself otherwise, deep down, he missed the familiar banter, laughter, and shared experiences that came with their company.

Ethan tried to fill the void by engaging in other activities; he spent more time reading, exploring new places, and delving into his creative pursuits. Yet, despite his efforts, there was a lingering sense of incompleteness, a nagging feeling that something was missing.

"It must be a new level of Stockholm syndrome," Ethan thought.

As Ethan arrived home after a day of being alone, he noticed something unusual while browsing the internet. News articles and social media posts revealed that dungeons had suddenly appeared all around the world, causing some of his classmates to be absent from school. It seemed that these mysterious structures had captured the attention of people everywhere.

Feeling a mix of surprise and curiosity, Ethan read about the experiences of those who had ventured into these newly formed dungeons.

"We can never take a break, huh," Ethan thought.

Ethan felt the urge to reach out to Hannah once again. He wanted to share the latest news about the appearance of dungeons worldwide and discuss the possible implications. However, he couldn't help but acknowledge that Hannah must be incredibly busy dealing with his mission and the widespread reports of these structures.

Realizing that Hannah's plate was likely overflowing with tasks and responsibilities, Ethan decided to hold off on contacting her for now. He understood that she had played a vital role in his journey and must be focused on analyzing the data and monitoring the situation globally. All of a sudden, Ethan received a message from Emily.

Emily: Hey, Ethan! Did you hear about the dungeons appearing all over the world? It's insane! Things are happening way too fast all of a sudden.

Ethan: Yep. I saw the news.

Emily: as usual, nothing fazes you. Did you go to school today? I was too tiredâ€¦ I am too tired."

Ethan: Yep, I went.

Emily: What a nerd.

Ethan: says the bookworm.

Emily: Have you heard anything about Ian and his family? I'm worried about them. I don't want to bother Hannah about that.

Ethan: But you are fine in bothering me. That will take time to solve.

Emily: I hope so too. Ian can be reckless sometimes, but he's a good guy. I'm sure he did everything that he could to protect his family. We should try to reach out to them and see if they need any help. Maybe we can provide some support or resources from our end.
