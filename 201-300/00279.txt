Chapter 279 Husk

Chapter 279 Husk

As Ethan was propelled dozens of meters backward with each devastating blow, he couldn't help but let out a small, almost exhilarated laugh. It was a bitter realization that his curse had shielded him from experiencing the true extent of physical combat for far too long. The monotony of defeating enemies with ease had dulled his senses and numbed him to the thrill of a true battle.

Varian was a doppelganger, but his strength didn't lie in copying his adversaries, but in copying their fighting styles and using the same against the users. He only had to do that when the enemy was on his level, and right now, Ethan wasn't.

"It is time to end this… I can't become a masochist either," Ethan thought while looking at the enemy with a serious gaze when he finally left the enemy's camp.

As Ethan fought against Varian, his mind couldn't help but wander to the mystery of his curse. Why was it no longer activating? What had changed? It was a question that intrigued him, but he knew that now was not the time to dwell on it. There were more pressing matters at hand, and the answers to his questions would have to wait.

In the heat of battle, Ethan's focus remained on the immediate threat before him. The relentless onslaught from Varian demanded his full attention, leaving little room for distractions. His mind was consumed by the task at hand - defending himself, countering his opponent's attacks, and finding an opening to strike back.

When the Varian punched the side of Ethan's right arm to open his guard, he suddenly grunted in pain when he felt his fist cracking as if he had punched a steel plate. Moreover, Ethan's arms didn't move at all after they turned into some kind of silver metal.

As Varian recoiled in pain, Ethan seized the opportunity to take control of the situation. With a swift and decisive move, he grabbed hold of Varian's arms, tightening his grip with a display of raw strength. The sound of cracking bones filled the air as Ethan applied pressure, breaking Varian's wrists and rendering his hands useless.

Feeling the satisfaction of gaining the upper hand, Ethan didn't hesitate to follow up with another strike. He propelled himself upwards, using his agility and momentum to jump into the air. With precise timing and precision, he directed both of his feet toward Varian's face, delivering a powerful and swift kick.

The impact reverberated through the air as Ethan's feet connected with Varian's face. The force of the blow sent Varian sprawling backward, his body tumbling to the ground in a disoriented heap. Ethan landed gracefully, ready to continue the fight if necessary, his expression steely and determined.

"As usual, you are terrible at taking damage," Ethan furrowed his eyebrows.

Ethan didn't let go of the Enemy's arm, but he kept looking at the others. It didn't look like they wanted to intervene… in fact, it seemed that they were enjoying themselves. While that was rather normal for demns, it was weird that they would do that in front of Ethan.

"... I don't like this," Ethan furrowed his eyebrows.

Ethan decided to use Earthen Armor to defeat Varian. Still, it felt like he shouldn't have done that… perhaps he shouldn't show much more before he learns what truly is going on.

Ethan's instincts kicked in with no time to waste, driving him to swiftly deal with the doppelganger. He launched himself forward, his leg arcing through the air with tremendous force and accuracy. The impact of his kick connected with the doppelganger's head, delivering a powerful blow that reverberated through the air.

The doppelganger's body crumpled under the force of the strike, unable to withstand the sheer power unleashed upon it. In a decisive and swift motion, Ethan discarded the lifeless body, tossing it aside with a dismissive gesture. He knew that there was no time for sentiment or hesitation in the midst of battle.

As the doppelganger's form dissipated into shadows, Ethan maintained his focus, aware that the fight was far from over. The enemy's defeat served as a reminder of his own strength and determination, propelling him forward with renewed vigor.

"Next," Ethan said.

As Ethan surveyed the battlefield, a sense of unease crept over him. Despite his victory over the doppelganger, the enemies surrounding him wore unsettling smiles. It was as if they were unfazed by the loss of one of their own, their expressions bearing an air of sinister anticipation.

Their smiles sent a chill down Ethan's spine, a foreboding reminder that this battle was far from over. He couldn't help but wonder what lay behind those eerie grins. It was as if they knew something he didn't as if they were privy to some hidden secret that eluded him.

The confidence that had surged through Ethan moments ago wavered slightly in the face of this unsettling revelation. He couldn't afford to let doubt consume him, but the eerie smiles of his enemies played on his mind, nagging at his resolve.

"I guess dying made you all lose some brain cells," Ethan said. "Huh?"

As Ethan's eyes widened in astonishment, he watched in disbelief as the lifeless body of the doppelganger began to undergo a grotesque transformation. The twisted form of the fallen enemy seemed to regain its vitality, its limbs straightening and wounds healing.

A sense of foreboding washed over Ethan as the doppelganger's presence grew stronger, emanating a dark and malevolent aura. The once-defeated foe was now revitalized, no longer a lifeless husk but an embodiment of sinister power.

Ethan's heart pounded in his chest as he realized that the enemy before him possessed a resilience beyond his expectations. The implications of this resurrection filled him with a mix of dread and determination. If even death could not quell the resolve of their adversaries, then the battle ahead would be far more challenging than he had anticipated.
