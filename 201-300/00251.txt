Chapter 251 Clash

As the battle raged on, Dante observed Ethan's incredible display of aerial prowess. Inspired by his comrade's skill and determination, he, too, tapped into his own abilities and took to the skies. He didn't like to do that often since a good part of his strength came from his legs and they needed a decent footing to work properly.

Dante soared through the sky with swift and agile movements, emulating Ethan's actions with remarkable precision. His agility allowed him to navigate the chaotic battlefield effortlessly, swiftly striking down enemies in his path.

Dante cleaved through the enemy ranks with each swing of his sword, delivering devastating blows. His movements were fluid, his strikes calculated and lethal. He weaved through the chaos, leaving a trail of defeated foes in his wake.

As Ethan and Dante descended back to the ground, they were met with a chilling sight. The area around them was littered with the lifeless bodies of their fallen enemies. It was a stark reminder of the intensity and scale of the battle they had just fought.

Ethan couldn't help but feel a sense of disbelief. Had they really managed to defeat so many adversaries? The sheer number of corpses scattered around made it difficult for him to gauge the true extent of their victory. Perhaps the adrenaline and intensity of the fight had distorted his perception of time, causing the battle to feel both fleeting and eternal.

The silence that enveloped the scene was eerie. The absence of any further enemies lurking nearby only added to the mystique of the moment. It was as if the adversaries had vanished into thin air, leaving only their lifeless bodies as a testament to the fierce clash that had taken place.

"What now?" Ethan asked. "You killed a bunch of them hidden, huh? Trying to hide your real skills?"

"You killed as much while transforming into a bat-lightning," Dante replied. "I can't feel the enemy's movements, and it seems that the weather conditions hid the vortex, so let's reunite with the others."

Ethan and Dante joined the rest of the group, all of them gathering together to assess the situation. Aline was still maintaining her protective spells, keeping the mist and fog swirling around them. It was clear that she could sustain her magic for a while longer, providing them with a valuable shield.

Emily and Ian stood by, watching intently but not actively participating. With Aline's spells effectively guarding them, there was no immediate need for their assistance. They remained ready to act if the situation changed, but for now, they took a moment to catch their breath and rest.

"The enemies aren't moving yet, from their base," Ian said. "However, the humans noticed that something happened since they haven't been attacked yet."

"It doesn't matter; they can't help under these conditions," Dante said while looking at the remainings of the battlefield. "Maybe we should change our actions to focus on speed… it will be more dangerous, but we will deal with the enemies all at once."

"It will be hard to coordinate with our numbers against theirs," Emily said.

"I can solve that," Ethan said to everyone using telepathy. "With the sword, and as long as I fight, I won't have to worry about mana. If something were to happen, I would be able to help any spot on the battlefield in the blink of an eye; you just have to ask for help."

"All right, Aline. Cancel the spell. We are changing strategies," Dante declared. "We will go full-on offensive now. I guess the vampires are at level one hundred in terms of power, but their skills are rather basic. I was expecting more of them."

The skills that Dante was expecting were a lot more… dark, so to speak. Some vampires possess the ability to seamlessly transform their physical form into various creatures, including bats, wolves, mist, and even monstrous abominations. This shape-shifting ability allows him to adapt to different situations, evade detection, and strike fear into the hearts of his enemies.

Some of them possess an exceptional skill in manipulating the minds of others. They can mesmerize and hypnotize their victims, bending their wills to their own desires. This power grants him control over their thoughts, actions, and memories, enabling them to manipulate and deceive those around them.

"Ethan and I will be the main offense again, but the enemies will focus on the backline if they cause more problems on a larger scale," Dante declared. "Once that happens, Emily and Aline will use their powers together to deal an even larger blow in the area. Don't worry about hurting us; just make sure to damage as many of them as possible."

Aline and Emily's tension was palpable as they heard the news that they would have to work together more closely than ever before. The air around them became charged with an unspoken rivalry as their conflicting personalities and differing approaches clashed in an intense display of unease.

Aline, known for her meticulous planning and calculated strategies, favored a methodical and precise approach to problem-solving. She valued organization and efficiency, always seeking to anticipate every possible outcome. Her attention to detail and strict adherence to protocols often led her to clash with those who preferred a more spontaneous and adaptable style.

On the other hand, Emily was a free spirit, guided by her instincts and creativity. She thrived on improvisation and the thrill of the unexpected. She believed in following her intuition and finding unique solutions to challenges. This approach clashed with Aline's structured mindset, creating a rift between the two.

"Mary will cover for you while you rest after those attacks, but I don't think that the enemies will have the chance to do much for a while," Dante added. "As usual, Ian will focus on getting rid of the enemies that might give orders on the battlefield. They must have some sort of hierarchy, and we can't afford to let them become a more organized force."
