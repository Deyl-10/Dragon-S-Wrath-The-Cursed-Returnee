Chapter 254 Cost

As the battle's echoes subsided and a semblance of calm settled over the group, Ethan found himself grappling with an inner struggle that lingered within his thoughts. The memories he had absorbed from his enemies, an unintended consequence of his unique ability, had left an indelible mark on his mind. Whispers of forgotten voices reverberated in the depths of his consciousness, a constant reminder of the darkness he had encountered.

Though Ethan possessed a formidable will and resolute determination, he knew that complete control over these haunting voices eluded him. Absolute focus was required to silence them, but such a state of unwavering concentration was not sustainable indefinitely. The weight of the memories, their resonance in his mind, threatened to consume him if left unchecked.

With each passing moment, the whispers tugged at his consciousness, a constant reminder of the burden he carried. The fragmented memories, remnants of his enemies' lives and experiences, mingled with his own thoughts and emotions, making it challenging to discern where one ended and the other began.

"I made this choice, so I can't complainâ€¦ still, just when I was returning to my old self," Ethan thought and then felt like sighing. "At least I got a lot stronger thanks to all this."

In the end, the group began to move South without using the carriages and the dulhans. They were too creepy and the last thing they needed was to worry about Mary getting nightmares over them.

While they could borrow some of the chariots or other vehicles that the humans in the area had, they decided to avoid contact since they couldn't tell how much further the real enemies had infiltrated on the army of that realm.

With the bitter cold of the frozen landscape still clinging to their bones, Ethan had an idea to alleviate the strain on their weary bodies. He had purchased a set of Spring boots, enchanted with a unique magic that offered not only comfort but also a reprieve from the biting chill. These boots held the power to invigorate and rejuvenate, allowing the wearers to traverse the terrain with swiftness and grace.

As he distributed the boots to his comrades, a renewed sense of energy and vitality coursed through their veins. The enchantment within the boots countered the freezing temperatures, providing insulation and warding off the numbing cold. With every step, a surge of warmth spread through their bodies, warding off the frosty tendrils of winter.

With the aid of the Spring boots, their movements became more fluid and efficient. The weight of their weariness seemed to lift, as they effortlessly glided through the icy terrain. The boots absorbed the impact of each step, allowing them to conserve their energy and focus on the task at hand.

"We are going to face the liches now," Dante declared. "We will stop to rest when morning comes and then we will face them before the sunset of the next day. We can't let the enemies that are influencing this world try to get on our way before we at least deal with two more armies."

"What about the battle plan?" Aline asked. "Unlike the vampires, the liches are pretty good fighting in groups. In fact, they would become a lot more troublesome by fighting in group."

Liches, with their mastery over necromantic arts and dark magic, had the ability to drain the life force and energy of their adversaries. Through their arcane spells and incantations, they could weaken physical strength, agility, endurance, and even magical prowess. Any large-scale spells or abilities directed towards them would be met with diminished power and efficacy.

This revelation brought a sense of unease to the group. They knew that their usual tactics and strategies might prove ineffective against the liches' insidious abilities. The liches' power to weaken their parameters could render their strongest attacks feeble, reducing their chances of success.

The group understood the gravity of the situation and the need to adapt their strategies accordingly. They acknowledged the challenge posed by the liches' ability to weaken their parameters but remained determined to overcome it. Each member recognized the importance of precision, strategy, and exploiting vulnerabilities in their upcoming battles against the liches.

"I suppose we will have to play it smarter now," Dante said. "I have no idea how we should do that, though. What about you guys?"

The daunting task of decimating thousands of liches before they could launch their assault loomed over the group, leaving them pondering the best course of action. They recognized that it would be near impossible to engage each individual lich directly, given their numbers and the potential consequences of engaging them en masse.

The group deliberated various strategies, seeking a way to tip the scales in their favor. They considered the possibility of launching preemptive strikes or ambushes, targeting key lich leaders or disrupting their formations before they could mount a coordinated attack. However, the sheer magnitude of the lich forces made this approach challenging.

Ultimately, the group found themselves grappling with the reality that there was no clear-cut solution to decimate thousands of liches in one fell swoop. They knew that it would require a multi-faceted approach, incorporating elements of surprise, intelligence gathering, and collaboration with other groups or individuals who shared a common goal.

"Just give me some time to think, and I will deal with the situation," Ethan declared.
