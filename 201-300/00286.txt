Chapter 286 Hesitation

"That is probably because you can't control them. No normal person has had a life where they only had suffering or only happiness," Emily said.

"It seems that we are heading to a cringe topic," Ethan shrugged.

"I guess boys at your age tend to avoid this kind of talk," Emily shrugged. "Anyway, back to what I said. If you focus, you can probably recall the good parts of the memories that you obtained as well. Although it is clear that the bad ones tend to last for longer."

"I am sure that will make me a happy-go-lucky person," Ethan said.

"I guess this conversation won't go anywhere until you see some results," Emily said and then sighed. "Get a random weapon and infuse it with your mana."

Ethan decided to give it a try. He reached for a small knife that was nearby and held it in his hand. Concentrating his mana, he infused it into the blade, visualizing the energy intertwining with the metal.

As he channeled his mana into the knife, Ethan observed a subtle change taking place. The blade seemed to shimmer with a faint, ethereal glow as if infused with a mystical essence.

The knife, now enchanted with his mana, didn't feel different in his grasp. It carried a subtle power, a trace of his own essence imbued within it. Ethan could almost feel the latent energy humming within the blade, ready to be unleashed at his command.

"Nothing unusual," Ethan said.

"Now try to change the mana properties based on your feelings instead of your knowledge," Emily said. "When I learned magic, I heard that some people from that world learned their best types with this kind of aptitude test."

Elemental magic is closely tied to the elements of nature, such as fire, water, earth, and air. The way individuals interact with these elements can be influenced by their temperament. For instance, someone with a fiery and passionate personality may excel in fire magic, harnessing its destructive and transformative qualities. On the other hand, someone with a calm and nurturing nature may have a natural affinity for water magic, using its healing and fluid properties.

Illusion magic is the art of manipulating perception and creating false realities. Those who possess a creative and imaginative mind, along with a penchant for mischief or trickery, may find themselves gravitating towards this type of magic. Their ability to craft convincing illusions and alter perceptions allows them to deceive, confuse, or entertain others.

"I guess it makes sense… I don't have an aptitude because I can act the way I see fit," Ethan said. "However, as for my fighting style… Dante and Ian's…"

As a determined and resilient individual, Ethan's fighting style may be focused on strength, agility, and adaptability. He may rely on powerful physical attacks, swift movements, and quick thinking to overcome his adversaries. His determination and refusal to give up may make him a formidable opponent, willing to push his limits to protect others.

As a cautious and observant individual, Ian's fighting style may focus on defense and counterattacks. He may prioritize studying his opponents' moves and weaknesses, patiently waiting for the right opportunity to strike. Ian's attention to detail and ability to analyze situations could make him an excellent tactician, using his skills to outsmart his foes.

With her analytical and strategic mindset, Emily's fighting style may revolve around precision and planning. She may excel in long-range attacks, using her intelligence to assess the situation and find the most effective ways to neutralize enemies. Her ability to manipulate time magic could provide her with an advantage, allowing her to control the flow of battle and outmaneuver opponents.

Ethan's understanding of his power was expanding as he explored the connection between his emotions and the nature of his mana. By adjusting his feelings and mindset, he found that he could alter the very essence of his mana, transforming it from a curse to a potential blessing.

Emotions hold a significant influence over magical abilities, and Ethan's realization emphasized the importance of harnessing his emotions in a controlled manner. By tapping into positive and empowering emotions, such as determination, resolve, and compassion, Ethan could reshape the energy within him.

"Instead of fearing touching others, why don't you just stop hesitating?" Emily asked while extending her hand.

"You are probably going to regret saying this kind of sentimental thing later," Ethan said while furrowing his eyebrows. "You are the type that writes poems in the middle of the nights, am I right? Can you tell me a few of them?"

"Don't think that you will take something; think that you are enough and that you deserve those around you," Emily said.

Ethan raised his eyebrows. That was a weird thing to say… then again, Ethan recalled some things that he had buried in the back of his mind.

In his pre-summoning life, Ethan had been a rather reclusive individual, choosing solitude over social interactions. The roots of this behavior could be traced back to his childhood, which had left a lasting impact on his personality and social development.

Once upon a time, Ethan was a bright and cheerful child who exuded a contagious energy wherever he went. He had a wide circle of friends and was known for his positive attitude and vibrant personality. However, everything changed one fateful day when Ethan accidentally overheard a conversation among some of his school friends.

To his shock and dismay, Ethan discovered that a few of his supposed friends had expressed their annoyance with his cheerful demeanor. They believed that his constant happiness and enthusiasm were grating and overwhelming. This unexpected revelation struck Ethan deeply, and it shattered his confidence and self-esteem.

Over time, Ethan internalized the words he had overheard, gradually retreating into himself to avoid being a burden or annoying to others. He became increasingly reserved, fearing rejection and judgment from his peers. The once outgoing and joyful child began to withdraw, preferring solitude to the potential pain of rejection.
