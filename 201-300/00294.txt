Chapter 294 Final Battle (6)

As the Lightning Armor materialized, its potent charge surged through the air, instantly incapacitating the two enemies that had been struck. The electric shock coursed through their bodies, rendering them temporarily paralyzed and unable to continue their assault. Ethan's mastery over his abilities had granted him a momentary advantage.

However, the remaining enemies, driven by their relentless determination, pressed on, undeterred by the fate of their paralyzed comrades. They charged forward, their weapons held high, ready to strike with lethal force. In a desperate attempt to eliminate their perceived threat, they swung their weapons with a chilling resolve, even if it meant cleaving their own allies in half.

Ethan stopped their attacks by moving around even faster than them and then colliding the enemies against each other. Still, they reacted fast enough to fly away and form an encirclement around Ethan.

"I should have expected as much since they saved other worlds," Ethan thought, then tossed away the two enemies he used as weapons.

Ethan assumed that D-rank heroes would have the stench of someone at level fifty, but considering the strength and speed of those guys, Ethan assumed that they were at level 250… it wasn't a joke.

As if that wasn't enough, the enemies raised their hands upward. As the enemies realized the threat posed by Ethan's Lightning Armor, they quickly adapted their strategy. With a display of unexpected unity, they pooled their strengths together, harnessing a dark power that defied comprehension. Their combined efforts resulted in the creation of a blazing sun hovering menacingly above Ethan.

This newly formed sun emanated an intense gravitational pull, distorting the fabric of space around it. Its immense gravitational force tugged at everything within its reach, warping reality itself. Ethan could feel the weight of its pull, a force that threatened to consume him and everything nearby.

"What the hell… even if they have those weapons, their magic shouldn't be at that level," Ethan clenched his teeth while trying to avoid being pulled to the sun.

As Ethan stood against the overwhelming force of the sun, a realization dawned upon him. The enemies' ability to combine their strength and create such a devastating gravitational pull hinted at a deeper source of power. It was as if they had tapped into the knowledge bestowed by chaos itself, harnessing its unpredictable and potent energies.

Understanding that chaos held the key to their formidable collaboration, Ethan recognized the gravity of the situation. The enemies' actions were not solely driven by their own abilities; they had accessed a wellspring of chaotic knowledge that granted them the means to conjure such destructive forces.

With this newfound insight, Ethan grasped the immense challenge before him. The enemies' connection to chaos meant that he faced adversaries who possessed not only skill and power but also an understanding of the very forces that shaped the ethereal realm.

"I guess it can't be helped…" Ethan thought and then made up his mind.

Still, before Ethan could go all out, he heard the sound of something approaching. The sudden burst of energy caught Ethan's attention. Dante arrived on the scene, his sword gleaming with an otherworldly aura. He swung his blade in a wide arc with a swift and fluid motion, unleashing a powerful wave of energy that cut through the enemies.

The enemies fell before Dante's onslaught, even though his sword never made physical contact with them. It was as if the mere force of his strike, bolstered by his own mastery of the ethereal realm, was enough to cleave through their defenses and strike them down. Dante's presence brought a renewed sense of hope to the battle, a beacon of strength and skill that inspired those fighting by his side.

In the midst of the chaos, Ian, armed, appeared at the enemies' rear. With precise and quick attacks, he unleashed a barrage of attacks and dealt with the archers. The enemies, caught off guard by this unexpected assault from behind, faltered in their advance.

As if responding to the unified efforts of their allies, Anna, Emily, Mary, and Aline joined forces, their combined elemental abilities manifesting in a stunning display of power. They conjured a barrage of ice spears that soared through the air, hurtling toward the enemies with icy precision.

"Sorry that we are late," Dante said while looking around. "Actually, you should be the one apologizing since you came in first."

"Are you guys fine with this?" Ethan asked. "They are people like us. Knowing you guys, I figured that you would get all sentimental later, and I would rather avoid drama and all that mussy stuff."

"We fought and killed to protect other worlds; why wouldn't be able to do the same for our own," Dante replied. "Still, let's make sure that we are the only ones who can carry this burden while the others only offer us some support."

As Ethan's friends stood alongside him, their expressions hardened with determination. The gravity of the situation weighed upon them, their hearts heavy with the knowledge of the devastation caused by the enemies' actions. Though they were facing fellow humans, the enemies had wrought immense destruction and taken countless lives, leaving a trail of devastation in their wake.

With grim resolve, Ethan's friends understood that the time for hesitation had passed. They recognized the urgency of the situation and the need to put an end to the enemies' reign of chaos and destruction. The sacrifices and suffering of the innocent demanded a decisive response.

The enemies tried to run away, but Ethan flew around even faster than before, thanks to his lightning armor, and then caught and finished off the enemies that tried to slip away.

As the battle reached its crescendo, a moment of astonishment washed over Ethan and his companions. Their eyes widened in disbelief as they witnessed a transformation unfolding before them. Once solid and formidable, the bodies of the enemies began to dissipate, their forms disintegrating into swirling masses of dark purple clouds.
