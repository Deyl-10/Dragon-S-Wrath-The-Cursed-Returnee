Chapter 233 Eventually

"That is a difficult matter… technically, we are soldiers of the country, and we respond to our country since our country will respond to us if we do something that causes problems worldwide," Dante said. "You need to come up with an idea that will make everyone know that it is better for you to work without following the orders of others."

"What about a technique that can make even low-level summoned heroes get stronger and some alien technology?" Ethan asked.

"... That thing that Emily was doing?" Dante asked. "I didn't think that is something that can be learned that easily."

"With the right teachers and with the right information, it shouldn't be hard," Ethan said. "You know that the lessons aren't making most of us stronger; only those who have the potential actually Increase in rank while the others fall behind. This technique will change things for sure."

Ethan was well aware of the risks involved in sharing his knowledge of Mana Force and the alien technology he had encountered. He understood that by divulging such information, he was exposing himself to potential threats and risks. However, he had his reasons for doing so, and they outweighed any concerns about the consequences.

One of Ethan's primary motivations for sharing his knowledge was to establish a sense of independence and self-reliance. By showcasing his abilities and the extent of his understanding, he hoped to persuade others to leave him be, to grant him the freedom to operate on his own terms. He believed that demonstrating his capabilities would discourage interference and reduce the likelihood of others meddling in his affairs.

Moreover, Ethan's focus extended far beyond the fear of his knowledge being used against him. His concerns revolved around protecting his loved ones, ensuring the safety of his world, and thwarting the enemies plans. The potential misuse of his knowledge ranked low on his list of worries compared to the imminent threats he faced.

"I will see what I can do. In the meantime, get ready for the mission," Dante declared. "We will depart tomorrow, and it might last for a while, so alert your family."

Reflecting upon his life, Ethan couldn't help but acknowledge the challenges and hardships that seemed to be woven into its very fabric. It was a constant struggle, a journey that demanded his unwavering commitment and resilience. While he had grown accustomed to the unpredictability of his path, it didn't make it any easier to accept the sacrifices it required.

Yet, amidst the uncertainty and hardship, Ethan remained steadfast. He recognized that his role in the greater scheme of things was pivotal, and his mission held immense importance. He had witnessed the consequences of inaction and understood the urgency of his calling. Though burdened by the weight of his responsibilities, he couldn't shy away from the challenges that lay ahead.

Deep within his being, Ethan carried a resolute determination. He understood that his life was far from ordinary, that the path he had chosen would always be fraught with difficulties. But he was unwilling to let adversity define him. Instead, he embraced the difficulties as opportunities for growth and transformation.

"It seems that your life is even more intense than mine," Luneria said. "I suppose you don't want me to go with you and help?"

I think you should take a look at

"You won't be able to focus on recovering your powers; things might change if I knew the flow of time there… but considering what Dante said, I suppose that won't help us," Ethan replied while checking his system shop. "This costs two million coins, and it was something that was unlocked recently in my shop, but it should help you recover your mana faster even when you are not meditating. Use it well to protect my family if something happens."

Zenith Amulet

Duplicates the effectiveness of Meditation. It calms the spirit of those who use it and makes them able to use Meditation at all times.

The amulet shimmered with an ethereal glow, its intricate design capturing the eye. Crafted from a lustrous silver, it possessed an undeniable allure. Nestled upon its surface were several blue gems, each radiating a captivating hue that danced with the light.

The amulet's centerpiece was a single large blue gem, the color of a serene ocean on a clear day. Its smooth surface held a depth that seemed to draw one's gaze as if peering into a hidden world beneath the waves. Surrounding the central gem were smaller, equally mesmerizing blue gems arranged in a symmetrical pattern that evoked a sense of harmony and balance.

Each individual gem possessed its own unique shade of blue, ranging from the palest azure to the deepest sapphire. Their translucent beauty suggested a connection to the elements as if they held the essence of a tranquil sky or the cool touch of water in their very core.

"... This is indeed a powerful relic," Luneria said when Ethan put the amulet filled with blue gems on her neck.

"That is nothing. The guy who made that had ten of those," Ethan said. "It is a pity that I destroyed the copies of the fight that I had with him… he was so annoying since his Mana Barrier was almost impossible to destroy, so I had to aim for them… anyway, it seems that I am recovering my memories alongside my levels. I suppose it is more efficient to do so while fighting instead of just recalling things by Meditation."

"I see, you can do that…" Luneria said as if she had understood something about Ethan.

"I am waiting for an explanation," Ethan said.

"As I said, it will come to you naturally, and it will be better that way," Luneria said.Ethan let out a deep sigh. His frustration was evident on his face. He had always been the kind of person who preferred straightforward communication, so phrases like "you will come to realize eventually" didn't sit well with him. It felt like a vague prediction rather than a concrete explanation.
