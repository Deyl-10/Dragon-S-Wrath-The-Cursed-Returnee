Chapter 202 Anti-Mage

"Why not? I won't beat you too hard," Ethan said. "With a few broken bones, I bet your face will look better, and you might have a chance with Lyla in the end."

Ian grabbed a knife from his back and then lowered his stance. At the same time, Ethan summoned his sword from his inventory while smiling.

Ethan blinked, his mind momentarily interrupted by a sudden sensation on his cheek. It happened so quickly, a fraction of a second, but in that fleeting moment, he felt a sharp, cutting pain searing across his skin. His hand instinctively rose to touch the source of the discomfort, and as his fingertips made contact with his cheek, he felt the wetness of warm blood staining his skin.

His brows furrowed as he contemplated the possibilities, his mind racing to piece together the puzzle of this sudden and unexplained wound. The taste of metallic iron lingered on his tongue as he licked his lips, a stark reminder of his vulnerability in this unknown situation.

"Fighting warriors like you is too easy…" Ian said while showing a cold glint in his eyes. "I will aim for your artery the next time… I can tell that only blood loss will stop you."

"Are we playing a game where we declare where we will attack?" Ethan asked. "In that case, I will kick your balls. I am not good at holding back, so perhaps I will cause lasting damage and your toy won't get up anymore. Well, not that is my problem. You pointed your blade at me, so you should have been expecting at least that much."

Ian's sigh escaped his lips, a mixture of frustration and resignation. It was clear to him that Ethan's intentions were not aligned with engaging in a serious fight, despite the glaring difference in their speed and abilities. With Ethan's power to absorb mana by touch, Ian couldn't deny the potential threat. Still, he couldn't envision a scenario where he would be on the losing end.

In a swift motion, Ian disappeared from view, his form blending seamlessly into the surroundings. His presence became nothing more than a fleeting memory as he repositioned himself, poised for a decisive strike. Without hesitation, he thrust his knife toward Ethan's throat with lightning speed, confident that his opponent would be caught off guard.

But to Ian's surprise, his blade met a barrier of mana, stopping it in its tracks before it could find its mark. A moment of realization crossed his face as he observed the translucent shield that had materialized, protecting Ethan from the lethal attack. It was as if a second layer of defense had instinctively manifested, a testament to Ethan's untapped potential and his uncanny ability to adapt in the face of danger.

In an instant, Ian's position shifted once again, returning him to his initial starting point. His eyes locked onto Ethan, a mix of annoyance and intrigue evident in his gaze. The failed strike had revealed a glimpse of Ethan's hidden capabilities, leaving Ian to reconsider his assumptions about his adversary.

"... It seems that you learned a new trick while we were away," Ian furrowed his eyebrows.

Ethan ignored the words and just rubbed his chin thoughtfully. Once he was done with that, he pointed his sword to the ground.

I think you should take a look at

Ian's keen intuition allowed him to grasp Ethan's strategy in an instant. As Ethan's figure plummeted towards the sandy expanse of the beach, Ian anticipated his intentions. It became clear to him that Ethan sought to exploit the decreased visibility caused by the kicked-up sand, using it as a shroud to launch a surprise attack.

"Warriors are so simple-minded," Ian thought and then disappeared again with a dark expression on his face.

At the same time, Ethan hit the ground with his sword and by using Explosive Impact. A wave of sand spread around the area, but since Ian was intangible, that didn't change a single thing… he instantly approached Ethan to attack him in the neck again since he could tell that the previous attack made Ethan lose a lot of mana, but when he materialized himself again, and his knife touched the layer of mana, Ethan suddenly grabbed his arm.

"Predicable," Ethan said while smiling.

Ethan could have swung his sword, but he actually tried to kick Ian's balls. Ian began to sweat cold since that seemed way scarier… his mana began to be drained at fearsome rates, and he was unable to use Intangibility. Until they threw a special bomb around Ethan.

The deafening roar of an explosive eruption filled the air as a magic bomb detonated with tremendous force. A searing wave of heat and destructive energy washed over the surroundings, engulfing Ethan in its fiery embrace. The layer of mana that enveloped his body, once a protective shield, now turned against him as it intensified the burning sensation.

Flames licked at Ethan's skin, dancing with a malevolent fervor, searing through his clothes and singeing his flesh. The intense pain coursed through his veins, threatening to overwhelm him.

Ian felt his mana stopping being drained, and he used Intangibility again and soon appeared dozens of meters behind his starting point.

"It seems that you have anti-mage bombs that are used to consume the mana of Mana Shields and similar spells, huh," Ethan thought when the flames disappeared, and then he showed his wounded body.

The sight of the third-degree burn marks etched upon Ethan's skin sent a chill down Ian's spine. He had expected his assault to have a devastating impact, to incapacitate Ethan and bring him to his knees. But instead, the resilient young man stood tall, his expression undeterred by the searing pain.

Ian's surprise was tinged with a growing sense of unease. He knew the power and destructive capabilities of his own attacks, and yet Ethan seemed unfazed by the wounds he had inflicted. It was an unsettling realization that there was more to Ethan than met the eye. This hidden strength defied conventional understanding.
