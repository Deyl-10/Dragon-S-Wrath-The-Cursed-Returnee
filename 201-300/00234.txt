Luneria, with her wise and aged demeanor, often spoke in such cryptic ways. She had a way of imparting knowledge that made her seem like a wise grandmother figure. Still, it sometimes grated on Ethan's nerves. He couldn't help but wonder if her age had something to do with her penchant for speaking in riddles and leaving things open to interpretation.

In any case, Ethan went to sleep since he could tell that he won't be able to sleep well during the mission. Despite that, he stored his bed on his inventory the next day. Before long, he was teleported to where Hannah worked.

As Ethan returned, he was met with a long sigh from Hannah, which immediately caught his attention. Something seemed amiss, and he couldn't help but wonder what had transpired in his absence. As he approached, he noticed the rest of his friends gathered together, including Ian, Emily, Dante, and Aline.

Ian's usually cheerful demeanor had been replaced by a somber and distant expression. His eyes seemed to hold a hint of sadness as if he had been grappling with something difficult during Ethan's absence. Emily looked concerned, glancing between Ian and the others, trying to gauge the atmosphere.

Dante and Aline, on the other hand, appeared stoic and focused, as if they were preparing for something important. Their serious expressions only added to the tension in the air.

"So, Ian. you confessed all of your crimes and let you off the hook?" Ethan asked.

Ian just looked away silently. It wasn't fun for Ethan if he were to react like that, but perhaps it couldn't be helped. His family risked everything to revive Kelly, but she lost her memories, and now they had to deal with the consequences of their actions.

"It seems that you are entering your edgy phase," Ethan shrugged.

"I called him for this mission, and the higher-ups accepted it since our group isn't that balanced, and his skills are pretty good for reconnaissance," Dante explained.

"I was planning to go after hearing that Ethan was going, but…" Hannah said and then sighed. "Maybe I should consider changing my profession once the dust settles."

Hannah occupied with her various duties and responsibilities, explained to Ethan that she wouldn't be able to join the mission and keep a close eye on him. As she described her commitments, Ethan felt a mix of relief and gratitude.

He knew that having a family member constantly watching over him could be both a blessing and a burden. While he appreciated Hannah's concern for his well-being, he also recognized the need for personal growth and independence. He believed that sometimes it took a family member to truly understand and convince him to exercise caution and make sound decisions.

In this instance, Ethan saw Hannah's busyness as a stroke of luck. He didn't want to feel restricted or overly sheltered during the mission. He wanted the freedom to navigate the challenges on his own terms and to learn from the experiences firsthand. Knowing that Hannah wouldn't be there, he felt a sense of liberation and the opportunity to rely on his own judgment.

"The final member should be ready soon," Dante said.

I think you should take a look at

"There is more?" Ethan asked while frowning.

Ethan's curiosity was piqued when he learned that an unfamiliar individual would be joining them on the mission. He had initially assumed it would be a high-ranking officer or a close acquaintance of Dante and Aline. Still, he quickly realized that his assumption was incorrect.

As he pondered the mystery, Ethan's mind raced with possibilities. Who could this person be, and why were they joining their team? The unknown factor left him intrigued yet slightly apprehensive. He wondered what role this individual would play in their mission and how they would contribute to the team's efforts.

"Now that we are here, I can tell what the mission is," Dante said. "Basically, we will act as escorts for a summoned hero that is going to start their journey today."

The realization dawned upon the group as they gathered and received the details of their mission: they were to act as escorts, safeguarding someone whose life was in imminent danger. It struck them with a mix of determination and a renewed sense of purpose. They understood the gravity of the situation and the significance of their roles.

The mission took on a personal meaning for Ethan, Emily, Dante, and Aline. They knew what it felt like to be summoned heroes, to face the perils of unknown worlds, and to fight against formidable enemies. They had experienced the weight of responsibility and the sacrifices it demanded.

The prospect of preventing another hero's demise resonated deeply within them. They vowed to do everything in their power to ensure the safety of their charge, to shield them from the dangers that lurked, and to navigate the treacherous path that lay ahead.

"How do we know that they are going to another world today, and how do we know the right person?" Emily asked.

"That isn't something that I can reveal; I am sorry," Dante replied.

"Someone that can see the future told you that, huh," Ethan said. "I guess that makes sense… still, to think we have a human-like that in our ranks."

"... Ethan, do you raise such possibilities out loud, okay?" Dante asked after a long sigh.

Dante didn't deny or confirm it, but the answer was obvious. That kind of power would be really useful in his hands, but he couldn't take it from another human without a good reason…After not so long, Hannah received the message that the final member of the team was ready to be teleported. He was left speechless when a girl younger than Anna showed up.

Ethan's eyes widened in surprise and confusion as he laid his gaze upon the final member of their group. It was a little girl, a mere ten years old, standing before them. Her presence seemed incongruous amidst the group of seasoned heroes, and Ethan couldn't help but feel a mix of concern and curiosity.
