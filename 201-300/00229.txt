Chapter 229 Return

Kelly expressed a lack of desire to go anywhere or engage in any particular activities. It was as if she had transformed into a mere shell devoid of her former passions and interests. She didn't mind staying at Hannah's workplace while the investigation was ongoing.

Understanding the delicate state Kelly was in, Hannah nodded and made arrangements for her to stay at the workplace. She provided a quiet and secure environment where Kelly could find some semblance of peace amidst the confusion that clouded her mind.

"By the way, what is that?" Hannah asked while pointing to Luneria.

"It is a super rare Pokemon," Ethan replied. "You want to know how I captured Luneria? Luneria can be found in the depths of Cerulean Cave, also known as the Unknown Dungeon, located just north of Cerulean City. To access the cave, I had to first defeat the Elite Four and become the Pokémon Champion. I found her in the deepest part of the cave. Luneria was a formidable opponent, so I was prepared for a tough fight. She was a high-level Psychic-type Pokémon with powerful attacks. Using my strongest Pokémon and moves to chip away at her health while being cautious not to knock her out. I inflicted status conditions such as sleep or paralysis on her to make her easier to catch. I used moves like Hypnosis and Thunder Wave to achieve this. I was careful not to lower her health too much, as I didn't want to accidentally faint her. I used countless Ultra Balls as well; once Luneria was weakened and status afflicted, I started using Ultra Balls since they have a higher catch rate compared to other Poké Balls and increased the chances of success. And that is how I caught them all."

Hannah couldn't help but let out a frustrated sigh as she facepalmed, her palm meeting her forehead in exasperation. Despite the seriousness of the situation and the emotional turmoil they were all experiencing her younger brother, Ethan, had a knack for spotting nonsense or making peculiar comments at the most unexpected times.

It seemed like Ethan had a way of unintentionally lightening the mood or adding a touch of absurdity to even the most solemn moments. His quirkiness and ability to find humor in the midst of chaos were both endearing and exasperating at the same time.

While Hannah recognized that Ian's antics served as a coping mechanism or a way to bring a brief respite from the weight of their current circumstances, she couldn't help but shake her head at his seemingly impeccable timing. It was as if he had an uncanny talent for injecting levity into the most serious of situations.

"... All right, you guys can go home; we will take it from here," Hannah said after another long sigh. "Thank you for your hard work; I will make sure that you all be rewarded for this."

"Finally," Aline said while stretching her body. "it has been a while since I flew so fast,"

"Thank you for your help, guys," Dante said. "When you need help, make sure to look for me."

With a shimmering light enveloping them, each member of the group was transported back to their homes. Ethan returned to his humble room, his body and mind exhausted but filled with a sense of accomplishment. He found solace in the familiar walls and familiar objects, knowing that his home had become a sanctuary during his time away.

After returning home, Ethan couldn't help but feel a sense of curiosity about the items he had acquired during his incredible journey. With a determined expression on his face, he opened his inventory, eager to assess the treasures he had collected.

Realizing that his old clothes were too damaged to wear, he decided to get rid of them. He discarded the torn and tattered garments, leaving behind the physical reminders of his past struggles. Putting on the fresh clothes, Ethan felt a renewed sense of purpose.

"By the way, you were strangely quiet once we returned," Ethan said. "What is the point of staying quiet after speaking in front of the others?"

"We weren't being watched in the world, but in the facility, we were," Luneria explained. "Also, Ivan and his family feel a lot of gratitude toward you; they won't do or reveal anything that will cause you trouble."

"I am not so sure about that," Ethan shrugged and then decided to check his progress in that single mission."

Ethan's mana increased a lot, and it could increase even more if he used his saved skill points, but he decided to avoid that and just go to bed and sleep for three days. Unfortunately, Ethan woke up the next day since he was fully rested, and his body didn't allow him to waste time and energy.

When he looked to the side, Ethan saw Luneria sleeping while standing like a real bird at the top of a pile of comics. He wondered if he should give her some bird food or something.

"I sense that you are mocking me in your head," Luneria said when she suddenly opened her eyes.

"What do you eat?" Ethan asked. "Also, I have to go to school; you can't accompany me, fight? Other people might feel your presence and realize your true nature."
