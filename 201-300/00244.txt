Chapter 244 Not Waiting

Vampires, on the other hand, were creatures of the night who sustained themselves by feeding on the blood of the living. They possessed enhanced strength, speed, and agility, along with heightened senses and the ability to transform into bats or mist. Vampires were known for their regenerative abilities and mesmerizing charm, allowing them to manipulate and control others. They were vulnerable to sunlight and could be repelled or harmed by certain objects, such as holy water or wooden stakes through the heart.

While liches and vampires were formidable opponents, Ethan also understood that their enemies had other creatures at their disposal. These could range from monstrous beasts to dark and twisted entities that had been corrupted by dark magic or ancient curses. Each presented its own unique challenges and required careful strategy and preparation to overcome.

"There is some equipment in my shop with holy properties that can deal with them," Ethan thought. "Still, that will only solve part of the issue."

Ethan wanted to deal with the situation in less than one week, but perhaps taking his time was the best option. He had no idea what kind of skills he would get from vampires and liches, but they should be really overpowered… so grinding them to high levels will be very useful.

"I guess I need to change my build a bit. It can't be the same as before… maybe I should focus on increasing my mana until I have enough power to fight even my curse," Ethan thought. "Still, Luneria said that my curse would become stronger alongside me… I am starting to think that there is no winning from this."

Ethan wasn't the type to give you, but six months without results sure we're annoying to handle.

In any case, while Ethan was thinking about that, he talked with his allies and confirmed that they were returning. He told them where they were and then arrived when the sun was setting. They frowned a bit when they saw Mary sleeping, but they didn't say anything. Ian would usually joke around, but he kept quiet since he was in his emo phase.

"The situation is worse than I imagined," Dante said. "The vampires are quickly coming from the north, and they aren't facing many obstacles since the people of this country split their armies into four parts. The vampires are close to two hundred thousand, while the army on that side is ten thousand. They are trying to use traps against them, but it isn't working."

"The liches are taking their time as well; they use blood golems and curse those who try to fight them," Ian said. "Southern side didn't suffer many losses, but they can't do much since the curses affect them for many hours."

Emily and Aline reported their findings on the enemies they had encountered in the east and west regions. In the east, they encountered hordes of skeletons, a chilling sight that sent shivers down their spines. These skeletons came in various forms, serving different roles on the battlefield. There were skeleton archers skilled in long-range attacks with their bows and arrows. Skeleton knights possessed formidable melee combat skills, armed with swords and shields. In contrast, skeleton wizards wielded powerful spells to unleash devastating magical attacks.

In the west, they encountered formidable witches who commanded the forces of ice and dark magic. These witches were exceptionally powerful spellcasters, capable of manipulating the frigid elements to create icy barriers, conjure freezing winds, and launch devastating ice-based attacks. Additionally, they possessed the ability to tap into the forces of darkness, casting spells that inflicted curses and drained the life force of their enemies. The witches' mastery over these elements made them formidable adversaries, with the power to freeze and hinder their foes while dealing significant damage.

Both the skeletons and witches posed unique challenges for Ethan and his team. The skeletons' numbers and versatility in combat required strategic maneuvering and teamwork to overcome. The witches' powerful magic demanded careful planning and the ability to quickly adapt to their relentless assault.

"The number of enemies sure isn't lacking… perfect for you and Dante, right Ethan?" Emily asked.

"I guess you see me as a bloodthirsty dog," Ethan said. "Regardless, Mary is growing fast, but not at the pace that we need here. Against hundreds of thousands, she can only do so much."

While Mary possessed her own unique abilities and potential, there were limitations to the support she could offer to the rest of the team. Despite her remarkable power to absorb and utilize the essence of monsters, her capabilities were still developing, and her experience was limited. She had made significant progress in a short amount of time, but there was only so much she could contribute at this stage.

Mary's current abilities allowed her to provide support through her acquired skills and powers. However, the scope of her support was limited by her level of mastery and the range of monsters she had encountered thus far. While her potential was promising, it would take time for her to grow stronger and expand her repertoire of abilities.

"Considering the advance and actions of the four armies, I guess we don't have more than two weeks left," Dante said. "We might gain some time if we split up, but that would be dangerous since the true enemies might be lurking around and waiting to kill us; this would be the golden chance for them. So, we will have to choose a target and then get rid of as many enemies as possible… perhaps even deal with an entire army on a single day."

Ethan was intrigued by the idea of directly facing the enemy armies in battle. He liked the thought of confronting them head-on and dealing a powerful blow to bring the conflict to a swift end. It seemed like the best way to put an end to the fighting within a week.

Ethan understood the risks involved in such a direct approach. The enemy armies were strong and numerous, making it a challenging endeavor. They would need careful planning, coordination, and strategic execution to have a chance of success. However, he believed that they could gain the upper hand and disrupt their plans by taking the fight to the enemy.
