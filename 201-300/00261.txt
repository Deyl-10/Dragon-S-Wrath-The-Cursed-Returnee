Chapter 261 Are You For Real?

While Ethan yearned for a break from the constant turmoil and pressures, he recognized that his duty as a protector and hero could not be set aside so easily. The weight of responsibility hung heavy upon his shoulders, reminding him that rest would have to wait until the threats were adequately addressed.

Despite the weariness that crept into his bones, Ethan pushed through, driven by the knowledge that every moment of vigilance counted. He understood that in the midst of a world teetering on the edge, there was little room for complacency.

As Ethan focused his energy on harnessing his mana and silencing the cacophony of forgotten voices, he delved deep into his inner well of power. With each attempt, he hoped to find a way to regain control and bring harmony to his mind.

However, Ethan's efforts yielded no immediate results despite his unwavering determination. The voices remained, stubbornly persistent, intertwining with his thoughts and disrupting his concentration. Frustration gnawed at him, threatening to undermine his resolve.

Yet, just as he contemplated taking a break from his struggle, a sudden and powerful earthquake shook the very foundations of his home. The tremors reverberated through the walls and floors, jolting Ethan from his focused state.

At that moment, all thoughts of self and personal struggles were momentarily set aside as a surge of urgency and concern coursed through him. He sprang into action, his instincts kicking into high gear.

"What is happening?" Emily suddenly showed up showing some crazy bed hair and then asked since the tremor wasn't ending.

"... Time space rifts appeared in this city," Luneria suddenly said. "I can feel this world overflowing with mana as well… many more of those will emerge. Something big is happening and it will change your world forever if it isn't dealt with as soon as possible."

Emily's eyes widened in alarm as the ground beneath her feet shook violently, the powerful earthquake sending shockwaves through the house. The realization of the danger and uncertainty that lay outside gripped her heart, filling her with an overwhelming sense of urgency.

Gulping nervously, Emily took a moment to gather her thoughts and assess her surroundings. Before Emily could fully process the situation, an unexpected force whisked her away in an instant. It was probably Hannah.

"Ethan, something is happening," Hannah said. "I don't know where yet, but I know that something is happening in our hometown. Go check it and keep our parents protected.

"I am on it," Ethan declared.

Ethan looked at Luneria, and she nodded. When he left his room, he saw his parents leaving theirs. It seemed that they had just woken up as well.

"Stay at home. I am going to check things outside," Ethan said. "I shouldn't take long to return."

Ethan's parents exchanged worried glances as they watched their son prepare to face the impending danger that loomed outside their home. Concern etched deeply into their faces, reflecting the parental instinct to protect and shield their child from harm.

Their initial instinct was to insist that Ethan remain by their side, to keep him safe within the confines of their home. However, as they looked into his determined eyes and witnessed the unwavering resolve etched on his face, they realized that he possessed a deep understanding of the situation and the capability to navigate through it.

While their hearts ached with worry and their protective instincts urged them to keep him close, Ethan's parents knew that they had raised a strong and capable individual. They could see the determination and conviction in his every move, and it reassured them that he possessed the skills and knowledge necessary to face the danger that lay ahead.

Though their parental instincts waged an internal battle, Ethan's parents found solace in their trust in their son. They recognized that he had grown into a responsible and resourceful young adult, capable of making his own decisions and charting his own path.

With heavy hearts but unwavering support, Ethan's parents bid him farewell, reminding him to stay safe and to reach out if he needed any assistance. They couldn't deny the worry that gripped their souls. Still, they understood the importance of letting him follow his own path and face the challenges that awaited him.

Ethan's parents stood in awe as they watched their son, transformed into a bat-like creature, take to the skies with incredible speed and agility. Their mouths slightly agape, they marveled at the sight before them, momentarily rendered speechless by the astonishing display of Ethan's abilities.

As they gazed up at the darkened night sky, streaked with the crackling energy of Lightning Armor, a mix of emotions washed over them. Amazement mingled with concern, admiration intertwined with worry. It was an extraordinary sight, witnessing their son harnessing his unique powers to navigate the world with unparalleled grace and strength.

Ethan streaked through the sky with lightning speed, his bat-like form cutting through the air like a bolt of shadow. His keen senses and heightened awareness allowed him to swiftly locate the source of the destruction below—a formidable army of ice trolls emerging from an underground parking lot, wreaking havoc upon everything in their path.

The scene that unfolded before Ethan was one of chaos and devastation. With their towering forms and razor-sharp claws, the massive ice trolls unleashed their fury upon buildings, vehicles, and unsuspecting bystanders. The sheer power and ferocity of their attacks sent shockwaves through the surrounding area, leaving destruction in their wake.

Without hesitation, Ethan descended upon the scene, his body transforming from bat to human form in a fluid motion. As he landed amidst the chaos, a wave of determination washed over him, fueling his resolve to confront the menacing ice trolls and put an end to their rampage.

"Are you for real?" Ethan furrowed his eyebrows.

Ethan's original plan was to fall like a meteor and then knock down everything and the dungeon, but he couldn't do that since the building was filled with people.
