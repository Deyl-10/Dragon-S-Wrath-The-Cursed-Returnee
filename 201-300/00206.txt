Chapter 206 Talk

Blinded by the swirling sand, it unleashed a relentless assault, attacking with thunderous strikes and sweeping movements.

Ethan, relying on his instincts and honed reflexes, maneuvered swiftly through the chaos. The golem's immense fists crashed into the ground, sending shockwaves rippling through the sand. Still, Ethan deftly evaded each strike, his body moving with fluidity and precision.

The sand particles whipped around, obscuring Ethan's vision and making it difficult to predict the golem's movements. But through the gusts of wind and the vibrations underfoot, Ethan relied on his acute awareness to dodge and weave, narrowly avoiding the golem's attacks.

As the golem continued its assault, Ethan seized every opportunity to counter. He unleashed swift and calculated strikes, targeting weak points in the golem's structure. Still, the creature's hardened coral exterior proved formidable. Each blow from Ethan seemed to barely leave a scratch on the massive guardian.

"That brat needs a better hobby than creating this kind of thing," Ethan thought.

As the massive coral golem delivered a powerful punch aimed at Ethan, he instinctively dropped his sword and braced himself for the impact. The force of the blow sent shockwaves through his body, causing his bones to tremble and his muscles to strain against the immense strength of the creature.

Despite the tremendous force pushing him backward, Ethan gritted his teeth and planted his feet firmly into the sand. He channeled his inner resilience with sheer determination, utilizing every ounce of his strength to halt the golem's assault.

With arms outstretched, Ethan's hands firmly clasped onto the golem's fist, his body straining against the tremendous pressure. He could feel the raw power coursing through the golem's punch, threatening to overpower him, but he refused to yield.

The muscles in Ethan's arms and shoulders bulged as he summoned his inner resolve. His veins pulsed with adrenaline as he locked eyes with the coral golem, his gaze unwavering. He halted the golem's relentless momentum through sheer force of will, slowing its advance and pushing back against its immense strength.

For a moment, a stalemate hung in the air as Ethan and the golem engaged in a battle of strength and willpower. The surrounding chaos of sand and tremors created an intense atmosphere, amplifying the gravity of the struggle.

"It isn't working… my curse," Ethan said and then sighed. "Ian, you asshole… you have been spreading information about me, huh? Not like I am trying to hide it as of late."

That was still annoying, so perhaps Ian deserved another kick on the balls.

With a surge of adrenaline, Ethan leaped onto the colossal arm of the coral golem, his movements fueled by a mixture of determination and sheer audacity. He swiftly maneuvered along its massive limb, racing toward its head with unyielding resolve.

As he closed in on the golem's head, Ethan unleashed the power of Berserker, channeling his inner strength into a relentless barrage of punches. Each strike landed with tremendous force, causing the creature's coral exterior to crack and shatter under the onslaught.

Again and again, Ethan's fists rained down upon the golem's head, delivering a torrent of powerful blows that reverberated through its structure. The resounding impact echoed across the beach as fragments of coral were sent flying in all directions.

Driven by his unyielding determination, Ethan's fists tore through the golem's defenses, breaking it apart piece by piece. With each strike, the creature's once imposing form crumbled, reduced to a collection of small, scattered fragments of coral.

As the dust settled and the remnants of the golem lay scattered across the beach, Ethan stood amidst the aftermath of his powerful assault. His breathing was heavy, and his body was covered in cuts and bruises, evidence of the intense battle he had just fought.

As Ethan stood amidst the scattered remnants of the coral golem, a sense of disbelief washed over him as he witnessed the impossible. The fragments of coral that had been shattered and scattered across the beach began to shift and reform, gradually reassembling themselves like pieces of a puzzle.

Eyes wide with annoyance, Ethan watched as the broken pieces of the golem's body floated back into place, aligning seamlessly to restore its formidable form. The cracks and fractures that had marred its surface moments ago disappeared as if the damage had never occurred.

In a mesmerizing display of regenerative power, the coral golem underwent a miraculous transformation. Its once fragmented and shattered body regained its original shape and solidity as if it had never been damaged at all. The creature stood once more, fully restored and ready to resume its assault.

Ethan's brows furrowed in frustration as he realized the extent of the golem's self-repairing abilities. It was a formidable opponent indeed, capable of restoring itself to its original state with uncanny efficiency.

"She seriously needs a new hobby," Ethan thought.

As Ethan stood poised to face the reassembled coral golem once again, his senses suddenly heightened, alerting him to a new presence approaching from behind. He swiftly turned his head, his gaze locking onto the figure steadily approaching him through the chaos of the battle.

It was Ian's father, a commanding presence with a stern expression etched upon his face. He moved with purpose and determination, his eyes focused solely on his son, Ian, who lay unconscious on the ground nearby. Without a word, he reached down and gathered Ian into his arms, cradling him protectively.

Ethan's gaze shifted between the formidable presence of Ian's father and the menacing coral golem looming before them. While he had hoped to find Anna and confront her about their actions, Ian's father's unexpected appearance added a new layer of complexity to the situation.

Ethan's instincts told him that this encounter would not be easily resolved. He could sense the gravity of the situation, the tension hanging in the air. The coral golem, once again fully restored, stood as a formidable opponent. At the same time, Ian's father exuded an air of authority and determination that couldn't be ignored.
